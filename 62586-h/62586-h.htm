<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile,</span> had I wanted solace, it
lay close at hand. Theresa was as kind
to me as she had been, on our first
meeting, rude. I rode with her, sometimes
twice a day, and got to like the
exercise so well, that I looked forward to
it with pleasure. I don&#8217;t say the pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
wasn&#8217;t immensely increased by my companion.
She talked charmingly, with a
mixture of vivacity and good sense that
made her conversation refreshing to listen
to. She <i>was</i> well-read, as her father
had affirmed, but displayed her stores
with so much tact and modesty, that I
never remember hearing her make a
learned allusion of which the appropriateness
to the matter under discussion did
not entirely extinguish every suspicion of
pedantry.</p>

<p>It was manifestly her resolution to
charm out of my memory the very false
impression of her character she had
sought to establish. The sense that my
heart belonged to another made her
feel perfectly easy with me. She would
speak her mind on a great variety of
subjects; sentimental arguments were frequent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
we could talk of love in an
&#8220;aibstract sense&#8221; like Sidney Smith&#8217;s
Scotch young lady; reason on the emotions,
and puzzle each other with metaphysics.
We were both perfectly honest
and knew no danger. Moreover we were
cousins, and everybody knows the nature
of cousins&#8217; rights.</p>

<p>Now I may as well confess&mdash;being of
opinion that a man ought always to
seize the earliest opportunity to tell the
truth&mdash;that, like most young men of
four-and-twenty, I was large-hearted: by
which I mean, there beat in my bosom
an organ sufficiently elastic to include
several objects at once. I have pretty
well established my claims to inflammability
by my brief reference to Pauline
(not to speak of the others, who are
nameless) and by the very headlong way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in which I had fallen in love with
Conny. I am well aware that among
a certain order of novelists and novel
readers, a hero is thought a very contemptible
poor creature if he does not
remain undeviatingly true to his first
love through forty or fifty chapters of
close print; although during his journey
through these chapters, he may have to
encounter several fascinating and seductive
young persons, who exert all the
arts they have acquired by a long apprenticeship
to the science of love-making,
to divert him from the straight path that
leads him to the altar, where, robed in
the shining nuptial raiment, stands the
Only and the True.</p>

<p>If this were an idle work of fiction,
instead of a solid and trustworthy narrative
of facts, I should, no doubt, pursue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the established system, and save the
printers a very great deal of labour by
enabling them to use some of their
stereotypes. But I carry my ink-bottle in
my bosom; and into it I dip my pen,
whilst memory hoarsely dictates and judgment
scowlingly corrects.</p>

<p>Now, do I represent a species, or am I
a unique? When I tell you that though
I remained fondly attached to Conny
through a large number of those days
darkened by her barbarous neglect, I
could still find a very great pleasure in
riding with Theresa, talking to her, listening
to her singing, and saying pretty
things with a tolerably significant face,
will you pronounce me an impossibility,
or allow that I acted as a great number
of young men have acted, are acting,
and will for ever act?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>Come, drop that stone. You know I&#8217;m
a species. Every woman knows I am a
species. No need to quote bacchanalian
lyrics, to mangle Moore, or steal from
Morris, to prove that a man may be
fond of one and flirt with many. But
since the testimonies of the great are
always valuable, hear musical Prior
sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;So when I am wearied with wandering all day,</div>
<div class="verse">To thee, my delight, in the evening I come.</div>
<div class="verse">No matter what beauties I saw in my way,</div>
<div class="verse">They were but my visits, but thou art my home!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Theresa gained upon me every day.
Fresh characteristics were for ever cropping
up to charm me with new aspects
of her nature. She was hearty, genuine,
cheerful; piquant with candour, amusing
with originality. Moreover, I found my
admiration of her fine face and figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
increase in proportion as I grew familiar
with them. The longer Conny remained
silent the more powerful became my
regard for her cousin. I pictured that
fair-haired girl devoted&mdash;to Curling; and
jealousy stung me, and turned me to
Theresa, and obliged me to think of
her.</p>

<p>And how did Theresa treat me? Amiably.
Her behaviour admitted no other
construction. But of one thing I was
sure; had she suspected the very
doubtful feelings that made my mind
wave to and fro like a Brahmin swinging
at a holy festival, she would have chilled
me into a very decorous and distant
reserve. Pride she had in abundance.
It peeped out in all directions. But it
did not affect her behaviour to me;
simply because she believed me heart and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
soul devoted to Conny; and attributed
any effervescing manner of mine to the
most cousinly impulses, and the most
laudable anxiety to be thought amiable.</p>

<p>I had been now ten days at my
uncle&#8217;s. He had begged me in his
hearty, hospitable manner to stop the
fortnight, and I had consented.</p>

<p>There had been a time during those ten
days when I was eager for nothing but to
return to Updown. But Conny&#8217;s silence
had made me rebellious. I have indicated
some of the thoughts that upset me.
Since she wouldn&#8217;t write to me, what
right had she to expect me to show any
great desire to see her? I said to myself:
&#8220;She ought to understand that I
am not to be trifled with. My feelings
are not to be trampled upon. If she
really cares about me, my prolonged absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
will chafe her; and an irritant may
serve to excite her languid emotion into
a good, sturdy passion. She will conclude
that I have found something <i>very</i>
fascinating in Theresa; thus, by reasoning
herself into a jealous mood, she will be
taught that she loves; my behaviour
shall attest my sincerity, and the rest
shall be lost in the murmurs of the
marriage-service.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, I should be untruthful to
pretend that my resolution to stop a
fortnight at Thistlewood was entirely
owing to my desire to pique Conny.</p>

<p>It was quite impossible for a young
man so ardently devoted to the sex as
I was, to be day after day in the company
of a young lady with finer eyes
than ever Reynolds painted, and with
such a figure as Canova had worshipped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and not be very sensibly affected. I well
remember leaning over her one day when
she was playing the piano, and sighing
inaudibly, &#8220;Yes! were Conny to deceive
me, here might I find her substitute.&#8221;
Did I start on becoming sensible of the
escape of so disloyal a sentiment? Not
I. I never started in my life at an idea
of my own. Am I a Radcliffean, an
Ainsworthian hero, that I skip in my
cloak to an impulse, and recoil with
bloodshot eyes before a fancy?</p>

<p>It was Conny&#8217;s fault. Were it the last
drop in the well&mdash;I mean, were this my
last breath, I should say, &#8220;Conny was to
blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>I loved her as fondly as any man can
love whose passion is fed by the beauty,
but not by the promises, of the adored.
Is beauty a good foundation for love?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Are the Goodwin Sands a good dry dock
for a ship? Beauty inspires passion, but
will it create sincerity? Something more
than that is wanted, I think. No love
lasts that is unrequited. No lamp burns
long that isn&#8217;t replenished with oil.
There are hundreds of verses among the
poets illustrative of this, the best of
which I might easily quote if I knew
where to find them. Don&#8217;t say this
digression is neither here nor there. It
is here and there too. It concerns my
sincerity; it vindicates my loyalty.</p>

<p>Riding with Theresa on a fragrant and
glowing summer evening, we fell to
talking about Conny. By this time I
had made up my mind to understand
that she didn&#8217;t mean to answer my
letter, and something like a sense of
resignation was lodged at the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
my being. All those tendencies to pull
my hair, to neglect my cravat, to write
verses against the whole sex, with citric
acid in my ink-bottle, were subdued or
dead. I had, indeed, my sneerful intervals,
but Theresa was always at hand
with her beauty for me to forget myself
in.</p>

<p>How the subject came about I don&#8217;t
know, but I remember that Theresa asked
me if Conny had ever answered my
letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered quickly, clapping
my hand, so to speak, over the nerve-pulp
her innocent question had laid
bare.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she does not think it
worth while to write, as she hopes to
meet you shortly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no excuse,&#8221; I answered sternly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
&#8220;I wrote to her eight, nine days ago,
and she <i>ought</i> to have answered me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Theresa lifted her eyebrows, and
thoughtfully patted her horse&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> would have answered me,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always answer the letters I receive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she loved me she would have
replied by return of post.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you mustn&#8217;t rush to severe conclusions.
A word will explain everything,
no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can imagine no excuse for her
silence,&#8221; I exclaimed sulkily. &#8220;Would I
have treated her so? Had I received a
letter from her, she would have had my
answer before the ink upon her pen was
dry. I hate to be neglected. People
neglect those they despise. She very
well knows how a letter would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
gratified me, and nothing but an abominable
theory of heartlessness,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;can
account for her neglect.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was fortunate for my horse that I
wore no spurs, or God knows where I
should have driven them to, with the
violent plunge I gave with my legs as
I spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this is rank heresy,&#8221; said Theresa,
laughing, &#8220;for which, on your return,
you will be judged, sentenced, and executed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is galling truth,&#8221; I answered;
&#8220;but if she thinks I care, she is very
much mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us suppose she cares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither of us cares. She never liked
me. It amused her to hear my nonsense;
though, for anything I know, I may
barely have saved myself from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
repulsive. A woman detests to be made
love to by the man she dislikes. Why
did she encourage me? A look would
have kept me off; a sneer dispersed me.
I&#8217;m not a burr. I am not one of those
adhesive animals whom no hints, no
open-mouthed aversion, can dislodge. I
am by nature so sensitive, that it is now
a miracle to me how I contrived to
tell her what feelings I had, before
I was sure she was willing to hear
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must make allowances,&#8221; said
Theresa, who seemed greatly amused.
&#8220;You confessed that Conny wasn&#8217;t in
love with you, and you have therefore
no right to expect any favour from
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll allow that she might have
answered my letter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Well, she would allow that.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll allow that there is nothing
more mortifying than to write a letter
and receive no answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes; that also could be allowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is gross rudeness,&#8221; I continued,
&#8220;even in a stranger whose reply you
don&#8217;t care twopence about. But in a
relation&mdash;a cousin&mdash;a young lady&mdash;a girl
who knows that the writer of the letter
she receives with silent contempt is&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Words failed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conny will explain when you meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care whether she does or
not,&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;My love has received
a blow&mdash;a wound&mdash;if it dies the
blood is on her head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; cried Theresa. &#8220;A lover&#8217;s
quarrel.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>I felt too indignant to answer. So
we jogged on in silence for some minutes,
I as insensible to the abounding beauties
of the evening, as if I had worn green
spectacles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t feel so vexed,&#8221; said I
presently, &#8220;by her not answering my
letter, if I were sure that I had no rival.
But I can&#8217;t forget&mdash;I never can forget&mdash;that
there is one Curling, a frizzy-headed
youth, cashier in my uncle&#8217;s
bank, who paid her so much attention
before I knew her, that her mamma
grew frightened, and forbade him the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you knew of this Mr. Curling
before you made love to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, Theresa, her conduct is
inexcusable. Oughtn&#8217;t she to have
answered my letter? Answer me that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8220;I have answered you that once. In
my opinion, Charlie, if Conny is not in
love with you, she is to be congratulated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh! how?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t think you are in love
with her,&#8221; she answered, fixing her bright
eyes on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am not, whose fault is it?&#8221; I
said, blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is an old French proverb that
says we forgive in proportion as we love.
I don&#8217;t find you making enough excuses
for Conny to satisfy me that you love
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love makes people critical and
harsh,&#8221; said I, &#8220;not lenient. I never
believe what a Frenchman says about
love. They know nothing about it in
that country. When I left Updown I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was in Conny&#8217;s power. She could have
twisted me round her little finger. But
she has chosen to ill-use me, and by
heavens&mdash;&mdash;who-o-o!&#8221;</p>

<p>The movement of my horse spoilt a
rabid peroration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider Conny treats you exactly
as you deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? do you really
think I don&#8217;t&mdash;I didn&#8217;t love her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You admired her, and mistook your
feelings. It is fortunate for you both,&#8221;
she continued, with great seriousness,
&#8220;that you left Updown, as your absence
has enabled you to test your own feelings
as well as hers. You would have married
her for her face, without asking your
heart if it contained a more permanent
emotion than admiration; and it is quite
impossible to imagine how unhappy disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
would have rendered you
both.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed outright, so much was I
amused by her cool and critical summary
of my feelings. I don&#8217;t know whether
she saw anything to disapprove in my
merriment, but she remained very grave.
There is no question but that I ought to
have been abashed; that I ought to have
cried, either aloud or to myself, &#8220;Can it
be possible that my cousin speaks the
truth? have I mistaken my sentiments?
Has a ten days&#8217; separation from the girl
I was prepared to adore, coupled with
a little trifling neglect on her part,
taught me a right appreciation of the
emotion I had regarded as the most
exalted and undying love?&#8221;</p>

<p>But I indulged in no such soliloquy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Looking at Theresa, steadily, I said, &#8220;Do
you think me a jilt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. If I did, I shouldn&#8217;t take the
trouble to be commonly civil to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you think I have jilted Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not said so. I don&#8217;t believe
she is in love with you, and a man
can&#8217;t jilt a girl who doesn&#8217;t care for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were conceited, I shouldn&#8217;t like
to hear that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she answered, smiling, &#8220;this is
a very old story. Pictures and books
have been made out of it in abundance.
Some silly writers vamp up a broken
heart as a condition of the tale, but
never yet was heart broken by people
who didn&#8217;t know their own minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her reins, and started her
horse into a gallop.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>I rode with so much assurance now
that I could admire her fine figure with
my faculties entirely unengaged by the
cares of the highway. How well she
sat her horse! How gracefully her form
responded to the movement of the
animal! She was a finer woman than
Conny. There was a tartness, too, in
her speech that made her language
relishable, with a spiciness I could not
remember tasting in Conny&#8217;s conversation.
I was both piqued and amused by
the very cool way in which she had
disposed of these sentiments of mine, of
which, after all, she could only suspect
the evanescence.</p>

<p>Only the other day I was thinking I
would rather marry Lucifer than such a
shrew, and now nothing hindered me
from expressing my admiration, in terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that would have borrowed a very soft
significance from my heart, but the apprehension
of a curt and contemptuous
rebuff.</p>

<p>Again and again I will repeat, it was
all owing to Conny. She had me once
securely; she might have kept me for
ever. Why hadn&#8217;t she answered my
letter? One tender sentence would have
made me her slave again. Echo not,
Eugenio, the remark of Theresa that I
had no right to expect a favour of any
kind from Conny. An answer to my
letter I could claim, not as a favour,
but as a right. Two lines would have
sufficed me. Yea, my bare address on
an envelope would have told me I was
not forgotten&mdash;that my tender breathings
were remembered. Didn&#8217;t she know the
risk she ran by treating me neglectfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
at the time that Theresa was my companion;
at the time that a fine, a handsome,
and an amiable woman was the
sole female society I frequented? You
starve your dog, and call him unfaithful,
because he takes up his quarters in the
house of a neighbour where he is affectionately
caressed and plentifully fed! What
vile logic is here? Treat me well and I&#8217;ll
love thee. Answer me my long and
amorous letter, and I&#8217;ll be true. Hint
that thy heart is not insensible to
the pleadings of my passion, and I&#8217;ll adore.
But leave me to quit thee, chewing the
airiest cud of unsubstantial hope, suffer
me to depart, making no sign, to be absent
and illuminate my desolate fancies with
no gleam from thy careless heart&mdash;What
wonder if I am found wanting? What
marvel if I discover in eyes as splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as thine, in hair as abundant though
darker, in speech more vivacious, intelligent
and characteristic, in manners as
womanly, as gentle, as dignified, a magic
that leads me from thy altar, oh faithless
one, on which no fire burns, to
another shrine, whereon it may be my
rapture to kindle an inextinguishable
flame?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Justice.</i> &#8220;Why, you little truant, how durst you
wander so far from the house without my leave?&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Scheming Lieutenant.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> it was because Theresa had
told her papa that I was in love with
Conny, or because he was too fastidious
to refer to the subject, my uncle never
once throughout my visit had a word
to say about his brother&#8217;s scheme. He
was highly gratified&mdash;as was plainly
visible in his broad countenance&mdash;to see
how well I got on with Theresa; but
this satisfaction I considered entirely the
result of his hospitable feelings. Whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his daughter misbehaved herself and
snubbed me, he had spoken in her praise,
for then she stood in need of it; but on
her dropping her mocking manners and
exhibiting herself as an agreeable, lady-like
girl, he said no more about her, good
nor bad. It was indeed as if he had
exclaimed&mdash;&#8220;There she is, my boy: she
is now herself; and you must find out
what you want to know without any
help from me. If you fall in love with
her, <i>bon</i>; if she falls in love with you,
<i>bon</i> again. If you don&#8217;t fall in love
with each other, still <i>bon</i>. I&#8217;ll not
trumpet her praises. I am entirely at
your service when you want a companion;
but I am decidedly unwilling
to lose time I might be very usefully
employing, in helping a young man and
a young woman to love each other.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>I thought none the worse of him for
holding aloof from his daughter&#8217;s and
my business.</p>

<p>When the day at last came on which
I believed it necessary to return to Updown,
he was heartily grieved to part
with me. We had been much together,
and I knew he would miss me. He had
always found me a good listener, ready
to laugh loudly at his stories, whether I
had heard them before or not. I invariably,
moreover, exhibited a great
interest in his books, of which he was
even prouder than he was of his recollections
of the great men of his young
days. There was certainly no one in
the neighbourhood who could take my
place after I was gone.</p>

<p>Theresa was also very sorry to part
with me; but there was nothing in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
behaviour to cause me to imagine I had
produced the least sentimental impression.
As I stood talking to her in the
hall, while the carriage was preparing to
drive me to the station, I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I write to you, Theresa, will you
answer my letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I will,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I
hope you will write. I shall be very
glad to hear from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have passed a most delightful time,&#8221;
said I, looking into her expressive eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear you say so.
Before you leave me, you must let me
know that I am thoroughly forgiven for
the outrageous reception I gave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it possible I could
bear resentment against you? You must
forgive me for ever having given you
the trouble to assume so disagreeable a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
part.&#8221; I added a little bashfully: &#8220;it
would have been better for my peace of
mind, perhaps, had you persisted in
being disagreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The faintest flush came into her cheeks,
and she immediately said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Write to me when Conny has forgiven
you for the wrong construction
you have put upon her silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t promise that,&#8221; I replied, quite
appreciating the little rebuff that was
implied in her remark. &#8220;She may make
up her mind not to forgive me, and I
should be sorry to depend upon her
caprice in order to write to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the carriage drove up,
and I had no opportunity for saying
more; which was perhaps fortunate, as I
might have committed myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind you come and see us again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
soon,&#8221; my uncle said to me as we rattled
towards the station. &#8220;We shall remain
here for the next two months; after that
we may, perhaps, go to Scotland for a
short time. Come to us, if only for a
night. You may depend upon a hearty
welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was four o&#8217;clock when I arrived at
Updown. How was it that, on alighting
on the platform, my heart didn&#8217;t throb
wildly at the prospect of seeing Conny?
How was it that, instead of my heart
throbbing wildly, I found myself thinking,
with a positive feeling of regret, of
the girl I had left behind me? Had
anybody asked me which I would rather
do: go to Grove End or return to
Thistlewood, how would I have answered?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t call me heartless. Suppress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
your sneers. Do people in this world
never mistake their feelings? are our
impulses always right? do we never find
they have directed us the wrong road?
Let the secure despise: they are in so
small a minority as to be contemptible.
The many are with me. Yes, there <i>are</i>
men who, having fallen in love, have
never had reason to suppose they made
a mistake. But how many millions have
blundered into spooning with the wrong
creatures?</p>

<p>For six revolving moons, Sempronius
dallied and adored: Clorinda was his
goddess, and a hundred poems distributed
among the magazines may, by the diligent
explorer, be found to survive his error.
But even whilst the seventh moon was
a mere line in the heavens&mdash;as delicate
a curve, my dear, as your eyebrow&mdash;Sempronius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the base met Sacharissa the
sweet. Hey, presto, pass! cried the
Magician we all know. Sempronius&#8217; heart
sped with miraculous speed from the white
bosom of Clorinda to the whiter bosom
of Sacharissa. There it still is&mdash;there
it will probably remain. Sempronius
the base is engaged to Sacharissa, and
Clorinda sailed for India last week along
with her husband, Major O&#8217;Ulysses. No
hearts were broken, no tears were shed&mdash;no
eyes became bloodshot&mdash;no hair was
torn out by the roots; the fact being,
that heaven in its mercy hath qualified
humanity with a marvellous power of
forgetting its mistakes, and of accommodating
itself to the first new condition
events impose.</p>

<p>I walked to my lodgings and there
found a long letter from my father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
It was all about my uncle&#8217;s scheme,
Tom had written a full account of his
fine idea for making my fortune, and
on receipt of it, down had sat my father,
to urge me, as I respected myself, to fall
in with Tom&#8217;s views, marry Theresa, and
become a partner in two senses.</p>

<p>A fortnight before I should have
glowered over the parental scribble with
bilious eyes; I could now read it with
complacency and appreciate the philosophy
that illuminated the illegible, but very
aristocratic scrawl. There was no
Longueville news in the letter. It
was all about my marriage with
Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;My horror of the sea,&#8221; said my
father in a postscript, &#8220;is as great as
ever it was, and not even Tom&#8217;s
hospitable entreaties could induce me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
set foot on the steamboat. But you
may depend upon my being present
at your marriage with Theresa; for so
great is my anxiety to see you in a
secure and affluent position, that I would
brave the fiercest gale rather than miss
the marriage ceremony.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having read this letter, and had a
short chat with my landlady, I pulled
out my watch, and saw that I should
have time to walk to Grove End
before they began dinner. I had not
written to tell them of my return;
but I assumed that they would expect
me, as in my letter to Conny I had
told her, that on no account could I
endure to be away longer than a
fortnight from Updown.</p>

<p>The bank was closed as I passed it;
but as it was market-day, I had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
doubt Mr. Curling was still hard at
work within. I was very meditative
as I walked. What would Conny
answer, I wondered, when I asked her
why she had not replied to my letter?
She would be pert, of course. That
would make me bitter. I should talk
with a bold face of Theresa&#8217;s beauty,
of Theresa&#8217;s talents, of Theresa&#8217;s figure;
if she was the least bit in love with
me, I would render her violently jealous.
I would humble her with comparisons.
I would let her know there were other
charming women in the world besides
her, that I had a catholic taste, and
could admire brown hair and tall figures
as well as yellow locks and blue eyes.
What! was my heart to be trampled
upon? No, by heavens! if she loved
me, let her tell me so; if she didn&#8217;t,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
let her marry Curling, and suffer me to
seek, unmolested, some bosom on which
to repose my well-shaped head and
aching brows.</p>

<p>I reached the house and knocked at the
door. My heart thumped an echo to
the summons. I nodded to the servant,
and strode in as a man might into his
own house. I hung my hat on a peg,
and turning round to enter the drawing-room,
faced my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; I exclaimed, taking
his hand and staring at his melancholy,
haggard face, &#8220;what is the matter? what
has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he answered, and drawing
me into the room, closed the door. My
aunt, who stood near the window, ran up
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Charlie!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
you think has happened? Conny has
left us! she has run away with Mr.
Curling! Think of her deserting us in
our old age! the cruel, undutiful, ungrateful
child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; I gasped, staring at my
uncle, and scarce crediting my own ears.
&#8220;Conny gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,
my dear,&#8221; to his wife, &#8220;it unmans me.
This is a dreadful blow, but it has happened
to many besides ourselves, and we
must be resigned to the common lot.
Yes,&#8221; he exclaimed, addressing me, his
lips twitching with emotion as he spoke,
&#8220;our child has left us. She went out last
night under pretence of spending the
evening with the Maddison girls. James
walked with her as far as the town, and
Conny then told him he could return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
home. At half-past ten we sent the
phaeton for her, and James came galloping
back to say that the Maddisons had
not seen anything of her that evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Instantly,&#8221; interrupted my aunt sobbing
wildly, &#8220;I feared the worst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seized my hat,&#8221; continued my
uncle, &#8220;jumped into the phaeton, and
drove to the Maddisons, who assured
me that my daughter had not been
to their house. I then drove to Mr.
Curling&#8217;s lodgings, acting upon a suggestion
my wife had made before I
started, and learned that the young
man had gone out two hours and a
half before, carrying a bag with him.
Hearing this, I went to the railway
station, and there learnt that Mr.
Curling and my child had started for
London by the train that left at twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
minutes to eight. My intention, then,
was to send a telegram to the London
terminus, desiring that my daughter
should be detained on her arrival; but,
I was told that by that time the train
had reached London. Nothing remained
but for me to return home and break
the news to my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was too astounded to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Charlie,&#8221; cried my aunt, clasping
her hands, &#8220;I so wanted you! You
would have followed her and brought
her back! but oh! it is too late
now&mdash;she is ruined&mdash;degraded! she has
shamed our name for ever! To think
that the baby I have nursed, that I
have loved and watched over with pride
and hope from the hour of her birth,
should abandon her poor father and me
in our old age! Oh, shame, shame!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
My poor Thomas&mdash;my poor husband!
it is too much for us&mdash;too much for us
to bear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, nay, have patience&mdash;have faith,&#8221;
answered her husband, seizing her hand
and caressing her. &#8220;Mr. Curling has
acted wildly, but he is an honourable
man. They both knew we should never
consent to their marriage, and they have
done as thousands have done before
them&mdash;defied father and mother, and
eloped. To-morrow we shall get a letter,
telling us they are married, and begging
our forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they have run away to
get married,&#8221; I gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;But oh! what a man to marry! Oh,
what a man to have for a son-in-law!&#8221;
raved my aunt. &#8220;I felt&mdash;I knew all
along that Conny was in love with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
him, and so I wanted her to marry you.
I was certain that she would never
be safe from that wicked wretch until
she was married. All along I was
certain of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We never went to bed all last
night,&#8221; groaned my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Thomas, Thomas!&#8221; cried my aunt.
&#8220;Why did you discourage my efforts
to marry her to Charlie? Why did you
tell him you could never sanction his
marriage with her? Didn&#8217;t I assure you,
night after night, that there was no
other way of saving her from that
wretch! My child, my child! where is
she now? Will she ever come back
to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will, believe me, she will,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;She will tell you that she never
could have been happy without Curling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and nothing you could have said or done
would have prevented this thing from
happening sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But to be deceived by one&#8217;s only
child!&#8221; burst out my aunt. &#8220;Has she
no heart? Didn&#8217;t she fear that such
conduct would break her papa and me
down, and put us into our graves? And
how cruelly <i>you</i> have been deceived!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t think of me&mdash;I am nowhere
in this grief. What can I do to
serve you? Give me some commission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I knew where to find her,&#8221; cried
my uncle, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t seek her. What!
bring her back alone, after she has been
away from us two days? If she returns
at all, she must return with her
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; said I. &#8220;We
can do nothing but be patient. Depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
upon it you will receive a letter from
her to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then as the whole truth burst
upon me, in one of those successive
shocks, with which an astounding event
thunders its way, so to speak, into the
mind, I shouted: &#8220;What a villain! what
a trickster! what a hypocrite! Never
by word or look, often as I have tried
to get the truth out of him, has he
given me reason to believe he cared a
fig for Conny!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then <i>her</i> treachery smote me, and
I gasped&mdash;I gasped!</p>

<p>At this juncture my aunt went into
hysterics.</p>

<p>What an evening that was! I wouldn&#8217;t
go through such a time again, not for
the love of all the fair women Mr.
Tennyson dreamt about. <i>Dinner!</i> We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
had no dinner. It was served&mdash;we were
summoned to it&mdash;but my aunt was in
bed, and the sight of food made my
uncle speechless. I swallowed some soup,
quite unconsciously, because it was set
before me; but my grief revolted at
solids. I could as soon have eaten the
cook as the slice of beef which my uncle,
with the tears standing in his eyes,
blindly hacked off for me.</p>

<p>Oh daughters, dear! what do you
mean by making your papas and
mammas wretched? Can&#8217;t you love
decently, and marry becomingly? Do
you think it fun to go running off o&#8217;
nights with men, and wringing tears out
of hearts you were sent into this world
to soothe and bless? Is romance spiced
by a mother&#8217;s lamentations? Is love
sweetened by a father&#8217;s groans? If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
think this, get along with you, do, to
the Cannibal Islands, where the people
who marry, first propitiate the gods by
the sacrifice of a relation.</p>

<p>As I beheld my uncle&#8217;s tears, I cried
to myself: &#8220;Does a man marry for <i>this</i>?
Does he soothe and sue, make presents,
and receive them back, grow cynical,
and leave his beard unshorn, laugh at
papa&#8217;s stale stories, and submit to
mamma&#8217;s acidity, for <i>this</i>? Does he
take upon himself the responsibilities of
a British housekeeper, write cheques for
landlords, wrangle with tradespeople, be
interfered with by his wife&#8217;s connections,
hunt after monthly nurses, sit up all
night with windy babies&mdash;to be made
miserable in his old age?&#8221;</p>

<p>Art thou a bachelor who readest this?
I warn thee&mdash;leave well alone. Hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
thou a landlady? Incline thine ear over
the staircase when thou hearest her
wearied husband enter, listen to her greeting,
withdraw to thy one room, flop
upon thy knees, and breathe thy little
prayer of gratitude that the hat thou
puttest on thy head covereth thy family,
and crowneth thee lord of thyself. Accept
this chapter as a tombstone, under which
moulder the bones of an Experience. If
there be no epitaph, it is because I
choose not to write thee a lie. Ponder
and pause, then go thy ways, moralising
on the lot of others, and grateful for
thine own.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;How say you! do you not yet begin to apprehend a
comfort? some allay of sweetness in the bitter waters?&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>Charles Lamb.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was twelve o&#8217;clock before I got back
to my lodgings. I had done my best to
cheer my uncle up, and certainly left him
a great deal calmer than I had found
him. You may believe he had asked
me no questions about my visit to
Thistlewood; the poor man could think
and speak of nothing else but his
daughter.</p>

<p>For myself, I never seriously reflected
how far I was to be considered affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by Conny&#8217;s unnatural conduct until I
reached my lodgings. Then, in the stillness
of my sitting-room, with nothing to
distract my attention but the picture of
my landlady&#8217;s husband, with a great
moon shining solemnly in through the
window, and all the trees breathless in
the night, I could think.</p>

<p>To think was to be shocked. What a
depth of duplicity was in that child!
Did I <i>now</i> know why she hadn&#8217;t
answered my letter! Oh fool, fool, ever
to have given her a thought! For
what had she encouraged me? for what
had she simpered and blushed when I
had looked and sighed? for what had
she allowed me, that Sunday evening, to
coquette with her hair and the rose? for
what had she called Mr. Curling &#8220;that
nice young man?&#8221; for what had she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
given me reason to believe that her
heart was entirely vacant, and that, if
I would be patient, she would some day
or other permit my image to take up a
permanent lodging there? I say for
what? and echo answered, Sot!</p>

<p>She had thrust me between her mother
and herself, so that my elegant shape
might hide from her mamma&#8217;s eyes the
love-making she and that rascal Curling
were enjoying behind me.</p>

<p>I had been made a tool of. Confusion!
how that cashier must have sniggered at
me when I wasn&#8217;t looking! how, when I
had treated him with the lordly affability
that is the marked characteristic of contempt,
how must he have revelled in
the reflection that he and his sweetheart
were making, between them, the most
consummate ass that ever walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
on two legs, of the very fine gentleman!</p>

<p>Here were the dregs of the nauseating
dose, and, phew! filthy and bitter they
were. It was no medicine. It was rank
poison; and my love, sadly emaciated
already, and worn out for want of proper
nourishment, gave a kick, and expired.
Yes, that night,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Down dropped my love,</div>
<div class="verse">My love dropped dead!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Blow out your candle, Eugenio, and
the sudden extinction of the flame shall
illustrate the awful abruptness with which
<i>my</i> flame perished. From that night,
from that hour of pride made wretched
by contempt, Conny was no more to
me than the scarecrow that nods its
blind head at the birds and flaps its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
idle rags along the breeze. I was in
her power once. My heart had palpitated
in the golden meshes of her hair like a
robin in a fowler&#8217;s net. I was hers&mdash;she
might have married me. But she
had preferred a cashier. She had chosen
for her partner a banker&#8217;s clerk with
frizzy hair; for a breast to lean on, a
bosom shaped like a pigeon-pie. Was I
going to gnash my teeth and hurl
ghastly looks at the moon? Does
Abraham Levi burst into tears when a
customer finds something more striking
and splendid in a piece of paste than
in a fine stone? I was a diamond, she
might have worn me: she had chosen a
Brummagem article instead, and by
heavens, Eugenio! no liquid gem distilled
from my eyes should add one grain of
worth to her outrageous choice!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>I was at Grove End early next morning,
and was met by my uncle, who,
without a word, put the letter he had
just received from Conny into my
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I prophesied you would hear from
her,&#8221; said he, and began to read.</p>

<p>What a queer letter it was! how
tender, sorrowful, triumphant, and pert!
Not a hint of regret. Curling and she
were married, and there was only one
thing wanting to complete her happiness&mdash;her
papa&#8217;s and mamma&#8217;s forgiveness.
Her dearest papa might be angry with
her at first; but when he should grow
calm, he would see how much better it
was for her to marry the man she loved,
and live happily all her life, than be
forced into a union with <i>one</i> for whom,
though she liked and respected him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
some things, she could never have the
least affection. (Oh, you deceiver! oh,
you little humbug!) Her dear Theodore
hadn&#8217;t much money; indeed, he had none
at all; and would her dear papa (how
they <i>dear</i> you, these little women!) mind
sending her a cheque, <i>uncrossed</i>? She
looked forward eagerly to his reply, in
which she was quite sure he would tell
her that she and dear Theodore were forgiven,
and then her happiness would be
to return to dear old Updown, and settle
down in some little cottage, which
Theodore would be able to maintain by
his salary at the bank. Her dear papa
and mamma might be sure that dear
Theodore wanted nothing from them but
his rights; that he was willing to work
for what he should get; and that he
<i>looked</i> to receive nothing with his darling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Conny, whom he had married because it
would have broken his heart to see her
Charlie&#8217;s wife, and because he worshipped
the ground she trod on.</p>

<p>This was the gist of the letter; but I
can convey no notion of its mixture of
love and sauciness.</p>

<p>I returned it to my uncle, without
comment, and asked after my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been far from well during
the night,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;slept but little,
and cried frequently. But this letter has
cheered her up. It has done me good
too. Now that I know she is married,
I can look about me again, and think
over what is to be done. But oh! my
boy, what a wretched day was yesterday
to your aunt and me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;you will write
to her to return to Updown.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I shall do yet,&#8221;
he said, shaking his head, and striding
about the room to conceal the nervous
tremors that from time to time shook his
frame. &#8220;Should not such disobedience
be punished? shall no rebuke follow such
heartlessness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! don&#8217;t let us talk of punishing
her. She is very young: she has
acted, I admit, with great thoughtlessness;
but remember, if ever a girl wants
sympathy, and demands the love of her
father and mother, it is when she is
newly married. Let me go to London,
and be the bearer of your and her
mother&#8217;s goodwill and forgiveness, and
bring them home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; he exclaimed, grasping my
hand, &#8220;I honour you for your kind
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>I blushed, and looked a protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has deceived you,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and if you can forgive her, ought not
we, her parents, to do so? But I must
think awhile, and confer with my wife
before I act. Conny ought to know the
torture of suspense, and be made to feel
a little the grief and fear she has caused
us. It is fortunate you have returned,
for I could not do without you at the
bank now.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was clear to me that the greatest
kindness I could do him was to
leave him alone. I therefore declined his
invitation to breakfast, and returned to
my lodgings, where breakfast awaited me,
and then repaired to the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. Spratling was very glad to see
me, and instantly began to talk of
Curling. Wasn&#8217;t it wonderful? Wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he cunning, just? Only the day before
he had run away with Miss Hargrave,
he had said he meant to ask the
governor for a holiday, when Mr. Charles
came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seemed to be afraid of meeting
you,&#8221; Mr. Spratling told me. &#8220;He asked
Mr. Hargrave several times when you
were expected. I daresay he thought
you would find out his game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps he did. Perhaps in his quiet,
cautious way, he was jealous of Conny,
and thought if he should give me time
to make love to her again, I might
win her away from him. He had very
well known that I had her mamma
on my side; that if my uncle had
suspected his daughter&#8217;s attachment, I
should have had him on my side too;
that I could claim to be a gentleman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that I was a prospective partner in the
bank; in a word, that I was hedged
about with every condition calculated
to secure me a triumph; whilst he on his
side had literally nothing whatever to
make him hopeful but Conny&#8217;s promises,
which caprice might at any moment
cause her to break.</p>

<p>I looked at his vacant stool, and
thought of him sitting there and laughing
internally at the trick he and Conny
were playing me; of the grinning that
must have gone on behind my back,
when my cousin mockingly repeated the
language I had addressed to her, and
mimicked the attitudes of entreaty which
I had no doubt unconsciously thrown
myself into whilst begging her to tell
me that&mdash;</p>

<p>Pshaw! never mind. It is all past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I never really loved her. I thought her
bewitchingly pretty, and wanted to possess
her; I thought it would be the agreeablest
pastime to play with her sunny
hair, and trace my haunting face in her
deep eyes. It was a young man&#8217;s fancy.
I fancied her. But could that mean I
<i>loved</i> her, when the first puff that
came blew my flame out, and left
my heart free for thy clearer radiance,
my T.?</p>

<p>Mortifying, fearfully mortifying the
whole thing was, I agree. To be made
ridiculous in the eyes of a cashier who
touched his hat when he met me in the
street and often called me Sir; to be
jilted for a lean banker&#8217;s clerk whose
learning lay in his ledger, the horizon of
whose mind was the circle of a sovereign;
who wrote like a copy-book, and counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
like the sums in Colenso&mdash;as accurately, I
mean (faugh! I wouldn&#8217;t give twopence
for such plebeian parts!). Yes, fearfully
mortifying all this was. How many years
have passed since then? It matters not&mdash;but
though my waistcoats of that epoch
would require another foot added to them
to bring the buttons and the button-holes
together upon my present dignified figure,
I cannot recur to this one great sackcloth-and-ashes
experience of mine without
feeling my spleen enlarged under my left
ribs, and my multifarious perceptions
grow jaundiced.</p>

<p>God knows whether I should have felt
so magnanimously disposed towards the
runaway couple had my heart been as
much concerned in the matter as it ought
to have been. All the morning I was
resolving, should my uncle show himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stubborn, to plead their cause and petition
his forgiveness.</p>

<p>Could I have done this had the injury
been deadly? and wouldn&#8217;t the injury
have been deadly had I adored Conny as
I imagined I did?</p>

<p>Well, Mr. John Halifax, perhaps I <i>might</i>
have shammed a forgiving spirit; I <i>might</i>
have acted in such a way, as to make her
fancy I bore no grudge. But I didn&#8217;t
sham, you dear model of a gentleman. I
<i>did</i> forgive her, John. Nay, I even congratulated
myself that she had put it out
of my power to show that since my visit
to Thistlewood my sentiments had undergone
a change. Had she not run away,
I must have transformed my aunt into an
implacable enemy by suggesting that I
was no longer her daughter&#8217;s humble,
obedient slave; I should have lost my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
uncle&#8217;s good opinion by exhibiting a character
he would mistakenly regard as
unstable and even insincere&mdash;for though he
objected to my marriage with Conny,
depend upon it he would not have relished
my defection; and lastly, I should have
been placed in the extremely awkward
position of having to give Conny to
know that my love was not based upon
that permanent rock of sentiment which
I had more than once sworn, with some
degree of violence, that it was.</p>

<p>In short, fortune had dealt me the
very cards I should have chosen from
the pack, had choice been given me. I
preserved my dignity. I could now turn
to Theresa without the faintest chance of
being called inconstant. My pride could
still enjoy, with undiminished gust, the
lamentations my aunt would be certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to raise over her abortive hopes; and I
could preserve my credit with Theresa,
who, on hearing of Conny&#8217;s doings,
would instantly account for the surprising
change that had come over my
dream!</p>

<p>My uncle came to the bank at one
o&#8217;clock, and finding there was little or
no business doing, called me into his
private office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my wife and I
have made up our minds as to the course
to be pursued. I shall go to London
this afternoon, and bring my daughter
and her husband back with me
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing you should do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t say that we are not both
of us showing very great weakness in
forgiving Conny so easily; but she is our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
only child&mdash;and the mother&#8217;s heart yearns
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so does yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it didn&#8217;t, I wish I could be
severe and obdurate. But we can&#8217;t&mdash;we
oughtn&#8217;t to fight against our instincts.
The young people must live with us
until I can furnish a home for them;
and, as for Curling, there is nothing for
it but to let him keep his position here.
The eyes of the whole town are upon us,
and it won&#8217;t do to seem ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. I know what my
father would suggest: that we all went
about, forthwith, boasting of our new
connexion, and appearing so proud, as
scarcely to be civil to the poorer neighbours.
After all, what is there to be
ashamed of? Curling is not ungentlemanly;
he is rather mercantile, perhaps;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
but he is certain to borrow some graces
from his wife, and to make as good a
figure in society as most young men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have given five thousand pounds
rather than this should have happened;
but as it <i>has</i> happened, we must make
the best of it. The first thing to be
done is to get them married properly.
My wife, I fear, will give us trouble.
She talks as if she loathed Curling,
and though she professes to be willing
to do anything now, I fear that when
the time comes she will never consent to
be seen with him out of doors, or to
prove, by her behaviour, that the marriage
is not a disgrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must reason with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. Sufficient unto the day&mdash;this
is a contingent evil: we have
enough to do to deal with the present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I was so grieved and worried last night,
that I totally forgot to ask you about
your visit. What do you think of
Theresa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like her very much,&#8221; I answered,
guardedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they make you welcome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think my scheme as disagreeable
as it struck you a fortnight
ago?&#8221; he asked, smiling languidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about this another time,&#8221;
I answered, uneasily. &#8220;Let us get Conny
home, and make her comfortable, before
we trouble ourselves with other matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, you are right,&#8221; he exclaimed,
falling quickly back into the one absorbing
trouble, from which he had momentarily
diverged. &#8220;I can leave you in
charge here, can&#8217;t I? and I must ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
you, after the bank is closed, to go and
keep my poor wife company. She will
be very dull and depressed during my
absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to cheer her up,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soften her as much as you can,
Charlie. She is all tenderness now for
her child; but the moment she has got
her again, she may grow severe. After
all, the poor girl will need her kindness.
I daresay she has fretted a great deal
whilst thinking of us all. She will
have missed her comforts, her pretty
bed-room, our kisses in the morning.
Eh? shouldn&#8217;t she be kindly received?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and she will be, I am sure,&#8221;
I replied, moved by the tears that sprang
to his eyes.</p>

<p>He squeezed my hand, bade God bless
me, and left the bank.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>There being nothing to do, I thought
I could not better occupy my time than
by writing to Theresa. So down I sat
at my uncle&#8217;s desk, and wrote four
pages. There was a great deal to tell:
Conny&#8217;s flight to be related, and a funeral
oration to be delivered over my love.
&#8220;I may tell <i>you</i>,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that I am
not so broken-hearted as I ought to be.
I am pained by her conduct for her
father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s sake, but has anybody
a right to expect me to have any
personal feelings in the matter, beyond
a proper sense of gratefulness that her
pretty face and capricious smiles can no
longer keep me awake o&#8217; nights, nor
prevent me from enjoying my food?
Ah, Theresa! you may indeed value
yourself on your perceptions. I am afraid
I never really loved Conny. How will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
this confession affect me with you? I
beg and implore that you won&#8217;t consider
mine a fickle nature. I could be true
and faithful as Abelard, could I but find
a girl who would be my Eloïsa. I made
a mistake. I admired Conny, and mistook
the delight with which I used to
watch her young face and profound eyes
for love. I won&#8217;t pretend to think that
I could have exhibited my present fortitude,
were it not for you. There is not
a quality that goes to the making of
my mind, that would not have smarted
and throbbed under this elopement.
Practically, I have been snubbed, sneered
at, utilised, dropped, cut, disliked, morally
kicked, and hopelessly sat upon; all
which unpardonable treatment I might
laugh at, had Conny been the only insulter;
but to suffer such indignities at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the hands of Mr. Curling!&mdash;Theresa, let
your pride bleed for me. Let me know
I have your sympathy. The briefest
assurance that your opinion of me is
not lowered because I haven&#8217;t broken my
heart over Conny, will give me all the
strength I need to support the very
crushing sense of contempt that visits
me, whenever I reflect on their duplicity
and my humiliation.&#8221; And so on, and
so on.</p>

<p>I was as nearly as possible telling her
that I had left my heart behind me at
Thistlewood. Who isn&#8217;t bold in a letter?
Consider the qualifications a goose-quill
and a sheet of paper confer! The stammerer
speaks fluently, without a gasp;
Ignorance pronounces all his h&#8217;s; Timidity
is as courageous as a wild beast;
Modesty makes love without a blush;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Poverty, by hiding his rags, can request
a loan without losing his dignity. I
added a postscript, in which I inserted
certain sentiments which, had I had her
with me, I don&#8217;t think I could have got
my tongue to utter. I then sealed the
letter, and walked with it to the post,
satisfied that seldom had love been so
well hinted at, that seldom had the
heart&#8217;s defection been so eloquently defended
by the submission of more incontrovertible
reasons.</p>

<p>The phaeton fetched me at four o&#8217;clock,
and took me to Grove End. I found
my aunt extremely wretched. She
thanked me for coming, and asked me
what I thought of Conny&#8217;s letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;she doesn&#8217;t
represent herself as feeling miserable;
and that I consider a good sign.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>&#8220;I cannot conceive,&#8221; the poor lady
cried, &#8220;how she could have the courage
and the cruelty to act with such wicked
daring. I seem in a dream. Every
moment I expect to see her come in and
laugh at me for imagining that she could
be guilty of eloping with such a man.
How my husband jeered me for saying
that his clerk was a dangerous person!
And now he is our son-in-law: now we
are all fastened together for life, and
degraded for ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no: not degraded. My dear
aunt, Mr. Curling is quite as gentlemanly
as the majority of young men. Look at
the sons-in-law one meets with everywhere!
Elopements take place in the
highest families. Only last year Lady
Florence Miller ran away with her music-master;
and mesalliances are so frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and expected, that I can assure you, if
two or three years pass without a groom,
or a dancing master, or an usher,
running away with a female member
of the aristocracy, the <i>Court Journal</i>
languishes, high life becomes uneasy, and
aristocratic circles grow haggard with a
sense of want. I admit that Mr. Curling
is not such a man as you would have
chosen for Conny to marry, but she
might have done worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she couldn&#8217;t have done worse.
So pretty as she is, with such good
prospects, she might have married anybody.
The cruellest part of it all is her
deceitfulness. She knew I wanted her to
marry you, and she pretended to yield
to my wishes, only that she might blind
my eyes to her affection for that Curling.
Didn&#8217;t she encourage you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; I groaned. &#8220;But I forgive
her. I forgive them both. They
have found out that Heaven made them
for each other; they are married, and
we must now help to render them
happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Long ago, at the first hint of danger
I gave,&#8221; cried my afflicted aunt, &#8220;your
uncle ought to have turned that young
man away.&#8221;</p>

<p>And here she began to weep and sob
wild reproaches, and to beg me to tell
her if she were not the most unfortunate
woman that was ever born, to bring a
child into the world that could turn upon
its parents in their old age; until dinner
was announced, when she took my arm;
and we walked into the room with such
faces upon us, as mutes might grow sick
with envy to see.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>I can&#8217;t say I enjoyed the evening that
followed. My aunt went into hysterics
twice, and wrung my nerves with violent
agitations of distress and horror. She
was not a strong-minded woman, and
took to her woe hungrily. I watched
her tears with the keenest apprehensions,
dreading fresh outbreaks of the sobs, and
short yells, and rapid heel-taps with
which she had twice favoured me.</p>

<p>However, she calmed down when it
was getting near bed-time, and I then
seized the opportunity of impressing upon
her the necessity of receiving her daughter
lovingly, and above all, of treating Mr.
Curling in such a way as should put it
out of the servants&#8217; power to spread the
truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our policy,&#8221; said I, &#8220;is to contrive,
by our behaviour to Mr. Curling, to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the neighbours know that the only thing
we regretted in the whole affair was the
elopement; that we were never averse to
Conny&#8217;s marriage with Mr. Curling, but
only desired that she should wait until
the young man had gained a better
position. If the subject is discussed
before me, depend upon it I shall be
explicit enough. The facts are these, I
shall say: Mr. Curling was impatient of
the delay Mr. Hargrave insisted upon
before he sanctioned their marriage, and
worked upon Conny&#8217;s sensibilities to elope
with him. It is the plot of the old
comedy, repeated afresh: the heroine
running away with the man everybody
had agreed should be her husband. Had
they waited a few months, I shall say,
they would have been married in state,
and champagne, sweetmeats and speeches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
would have made the union respectable.
But they chose to elope and antedate
their bliss by express train to Doctor&#8217;s
Commons. These things have happened
ever since the better part of Adam manifested
itself in the shape of Eve. They
happen most frequently in high life;
and an elopement, so far from being
regarded as a disgrace, is universally held
to be a first-class sign of politeness and
breeding. That&#8217;s how I shall talk, aunt;
and I would advise you to do the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>I fancy my reasoning impressed her.
She always had a high opinion of my
knowledge of human nature, and believed
the world contained not many persons who
were my equals in elegance of deportment
and accuracy of judgment in matters of
fashion and behaviour. I left her at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
eleven o&#8217;clock, not sorry to escape into
the cool night, where, amid the stillness,
I could dedicate my thoughts to
Theresa.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Bland.</i> &#8220;Never mention what is past. The
wranglings of married people about unlucky questions
that break out between them is like the lashing
of a top: it only serves to keep it up the longer.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>All in the Wrong.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day business was a little brisk
at the bank, and, considering my short
apprenticeship, I acquitted myself tolerably
well. I took Curling&#8217;s place and paid or
received the cheques, &amp;c., as they were
presented, and what was extremely wonderful,
found at the end of the day that
I had made no mistake. I also conferred
with two or three customers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
manager&#8217;s private room, performing the
simple duty of listening to them with a
very grave face, and dismissing them in
a style that excited Mr. Spratling, who
had a slow and laborious mind, into
applause.</p>

<p>When the bank was closed I went to
my lodgings to get some dinner, not
intending to call at Grove End until late
in the evening. The fact was, my uncle
had spoken of leaving London with the
devoted couple at four o&#8217;clock; Updown
would be reached by seven, and I had no
wish to intrude until the violence and
agitation of the meeting at Grove End
should be in some degree calmed.</p>

<p>My dinner, composed of a mutton chop
and a pint of red wine, was soon despatched.
I pulled an arm-chair to the
open window, lighted a pipe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
surrendered myself up to various reflections.</p>

<p>Among other things, I remember thinking
how very pretty my landlady&#8217;s house
was, how snugly it would accommodate a
newly-married pair&mdash;and then I thought
of Theresa.</p>

<p>In imagination I pictured her my wife,
moving, at this sunset hour, with watering-pot
in hand, among the flowers in
the garden, ever and anon creeping up
to the window, where I was seated, to
give me a flower, and let me take a
long look into her bright and speaking
eyes.</p>

<p>Heavens! how the wheel goes round!
Not very long before I had figured
another young lady as my wife, offering
me flowers through that very identical
window, with all the sweetness of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
spirit beaming like the moon in the dark
azure of her eyes. That picture was
blotted out. Did I care? A fiddle!
I liked the other picture much better.
Why, even that reverence, which, despite
Conny&#8217;s indifference to me, I should ever
have remembered her beauty with, was
sunk, was destroyed by the consideration
that her name was now <span class="smcap">Curling</span>, and
that the frizzy cashier was privileged to
call her <span class="smcap">His</span>!</p>

<p>His! Imagine that cockneyfied forefinger,
that long forefinger with the olive-coloured
nail and the dreadful ring, chucking
Conny&#8217;s dimpled chin, playing
with Conny&#8217;s golden hair! Faugh! The
rose that makes the beauties of your
sweetheart&#8217;s white bosom killing, becomes
a sordid, vulgar flower when transferred
on the morrow to the char-woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and pinned by her against the
dirt of the handkerchief about her chest.
Though idealism has its limits, yet its
circle had been a big one for Conny,
and there was little she could have done
in it <i>alone</i> that would have endangered
her charms in my eyes. But she had
chosen to lug Mr. Curling into the magic
realm; and souse! the spell was broken.</p>

<p>It was like throwing a duck into a
lake, in whose lucent serenity the stars
of the heavens found their duplicates.</p>

<p>Now, whilst I thus sate, the postman
came into the garden and handed me
a letter. I caught sight of the initials
&#8220;T. H.&#8221; at the corner of the envelope, and
my heart beat quickly. I pulled out the
enclosure. What a fine, free, dashing
hand! How firm and honest and characteristic!
How thoughtful to answer my letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
so soon! Why, she could only have
received it that morning, and must therefore
have written her reply on the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Charlie,&#8221; she began: and
then went on to express her astonishment
and grief at the news I had sent
her of Conny&#8217;s elopement. She could
scarcely credit I was in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;What mad impulse could have
prompted her to take such a step! How
grieved my uncle and aunt must be!
Surely had they suspected that Conny
was so fond of this young man, they
would have allowed her to marry him,
rather than drive her into an elopement
by their refusal. Papa is perfectly
stupefied; for he told me that uncle
Tom had over and over again expressed
his belief, that Conny would marry
well.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&#8220;As for <i>you</i>, I am not so surprised
as you fancied I should be, to hear
that Conny&#8217;s rash act has not broken
your heart. I told you plainly one day
that you didn&#8217;t love her, and now
you confess I was right. Again and
again I tell you that your fickleness, as
you call it, cannot affect my opinion of
you. Had you sincerely loved her,
taught her to love you, and then turned
from her, no words of mine could
possibly convey how greatly I should
despise you. I don&#8217;t mean to say that
I or any other woman could think the
<i>better</i> of a man for not knowing his own
mind. Judgment is a fine quality in a
man, and without it he can never be
devoted, or honest, or resolute.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I told you, during that rude fit
of mine, that you were a boy&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
you are&mdash;and are therefore to be
laughed at and excused for falling into
an ecstasy over the first pretty face
you meet, and calling your silly
transports, <i>love</i>! You have been
punished severely enough through your
self-conceit; and I can imagine that
you will never care to be reminded,
that at the time you were thinking
you had made a conquest of Conny,
she was encouraging you merely that
you might serve her as a kind of
dummy, with whom she might coquette
whilst she indulged her real passion
with her Theodore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having written so far, she was pleased
to suspend her raillery, to make way for
large-hearted expressions of sympathy
with Tom and his wife, and concluded
a tolerably voluminous letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
by signing herself &#8220;Your affectionate
cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P.S. Tell me all the news as it
comes to hand, that is if you can find
any time to waste upon T. H.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was so much piqued and so much
pleased with this letter, that, had I had
any further news to tell her&mdash;enough
to find me an excuse for writing so
promptly&mdash;I should there and then have
sent her a reply. The part I liked most
was where she had called me a boy. It
was delightful to be rallied so familiarly,
to be chided so saucily. And I noticed
the dexterity with which she implied
apologies and excuses for the conduct
she seemed to reproach in me.</p>

<p>However, it was now about time that
I made my way to Grove End. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
but a sense of duty could have driven
me there, I assure you.</p>

<p>I reached the house a little before
nine o&#8217;clock, and knocked very tremulously;
I never remember feeling more
nervous. What should I say to Conny&mdash;to
<i>Mrs. Curling</i>, I mean? and what
was Mrs. Curling to say to me?</p>

<p>When I entered the hall, I could
scarcely do anything for some moments
but wipe my feet. Then I knocked my
uncle&#8217;s hat off a peg in trying to hang
up my own. The servant opened the
drawing-room door, and giving my faculties
a twist, as it were, to make them
resonant, I entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo!&#8221; said I, seeing the room
empty, though the lamps were lighted,
&#8220;where&#8217;s my uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>In truth, I had forgotten, in my
nervousness, to inquire whether he had
returned from London.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and see, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he has come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; Mr. and Mrs. Curling have come
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>What adaptive aptitude servants have!
How long would it take me to talk of
&#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Curling&#8221; as glibly as if they
had been man and wife ten years?</p>

<p>I sat down and pretended to feel at
my ease, meanwhile watching the door
anxiously. In about three minutes&#8217; time
it opened, and in came&mdash;everybody!
Yes, I protest all my relations swarmed
in at once. First came my uncle, with
his shirt collars well up above his ears;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
then came my aunt with red eyes; then
came Conny looking white as a sheet:
and then came Curling&mdash;already a bruised
and broken son-in-law, glancing with
scared eyes about him, and stepping forward
with the nervous, dubious air you
may have observed in a decayed tradesman,
who, having called four times with
a subscription paper, is mistaken by your
servant, and asked to &#8220;walk in.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood up, not knowing whom to
shake hands with first.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Charlie?&#8221; said my
uncle in a melancholy voice. &#8220;We were
all in the library when you came.&#8221;</p>

<p>My aunt took an arm-chair, breathing
noisily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to welcome you home,&#8221;
said I, taking Conny&#8217;s hand, and feeling
as if I were saluting a stranger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she whispered, hanging
her head; and then gave her husband a
glance.</p>

<p>Poor little girl! I knew what she
meant. The eyes of the mother were
upon me; I was the Representative of
the Family Gentility. My soul warmed
to a magnanimous impulse, and, extending
my hand cordially to Mr. Curling,
I exclaimed in a loud, impressive
voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;I heartily congratulate you on your
choice of a wife; and I hope you will
both be spared for many long years to
be a comfort to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boh! boh! Conny burst into tears,
ran up to me, clung to my arm, and upturning
her sweet, deceitful eyes, now
with their rich blue deepened by tears,
cried,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Charlie, I knew you would forgive
me! I always felt you would! Do
ask mamma to love me again, and to be
friends with Theodore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will need no asking,&#8221; I answered,
feeling perfectly patriarchal, and thinking
what a mean figure I was involuntarily
making Mr. Theodore cut. &#8220;Her heart
is the kindest that ever beat in a woman&#8217;s
bosom; and I shall be greatly mistaken
if, after you have allowed her a little
breathing time, to recover the shock, she
does not clasp her only, her beloved child
again to her breast, and forgive the man
whose only sin has been that he has
loved her daughter too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having uttered which surprising piece
of eloquence, I was confounded by my
uncle bursting into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me,&#8221; he sobbed, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
his fingers; &#8220;I entreat&mdash;I implore that
none of you will look at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear husband!&#8221; shrieked his
wife, rushing up to him, and casting her
arms around his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa, papa!&#8221; cried Conny, likewise
running up to him, casting herself on her
knees and fondling his legs.</p>

<p>To complete the tableau nothing was
wanting but for Mr. Curling and me to
lock each other&#8217;s figure in a passionate
embrace. But I would rather have been
poisoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, there!&#8221; mumbled my
poor uncle, releasing himself from his
wife and child by struggling out of his
chair. &#8220;I must apologise for my weakness.
God knows how many years it
is since I shed a tear. Charlie, my boy,
pray be seated. Curling, raise your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>However, Conny saved her husband
this trouble by getting up herself. My
aunt resumed her chair; Curling took
the music-stool, and my uncle and I
shared the sofa.</p>

<p>The silence that followed was exquisitely
embarrassing. I gasped and
gulped about in my mind for something
to say, but was as absolutely vacant of
ideas as a foolish and nervous &#8220;best
man,&#8221; who rises to propose &#8220;the bridesmaids,&#8221;
and can do nothing for a long and
awful pause but fix a fishy eye on
the person immediately opposite.</p>

<p>Conny never looked at me. Her
swollen blue eyes were glued to the
carpet. As for my aunt, her face was
as stony and hard as anything ever
found by Mr. Layard at Nineveh. At
last, feeling the silence too oppressive for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
my nerves to endure without something
cracking, I asked my uncle, in a voice
that appeared to me fearfully loud,</p>

<p>&#8220;How is London looking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much as usual,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>And his tongue being loosened, he proceeded
to inquire after the business that
had been transacted at the bank during
his absence. We were now upon a subject
in which Curling would feel at home, and
heartily sorry for the poor fellow whose
position was, on the whole, as unenviable
as any mortal man was ever placed in,
I contrived to address some observations
to him, which he answered with great
diffidence. I then, from a laudable desire
to diffuse a more pleasing social atmosphere
than then overhung us, spoke to
my aunt, taking care, on receiving her
reply, to appeal to Conny.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>But my well-meant effort failed. My
aunt was so dogged and tearful, I might
as well have tried to set the pendulum of
a clock wagging when the spring was
broken, as have attempted to get her to
be cheerful.</p>

<p>&#8220;We make a happy family party, don&#8217;t
we,&#8221; said she to me with a ghastly smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;I for one am quite disposed to
be comfortable,&#8221; and I looked at Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said my aunt with a severe nod,
&#8220;you are not a mother, Charlie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and I really hope there
is no chance of my ever becoming one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Curling grinned faintly. Conny
looked at me askew, as if she wondered
how I could find the heart to be funny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, don&#8217;t let us get personal,&#8221;
exclaimed my uncle. &#8220;What I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Conny and her husband in London I will
repeat here; they have chosen to act
foolishly and cruelly; but greatly as they
have made us suffer, it is our duty, now
that the action is irreparable, not only
to wish to see them happy, but to strive
to make them so. It is too late to show
any temper, and all reproaches must be
idle and foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but flesh and blood must speak!&#8221;
cried out my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret the grief and pain I have
caused you and Mrs. Hargrave,&#8221; said
Curling. &#8220;But when I remember what
I owe you, sir, when I know that I am
not incapable of gratitude, and that the
character I have always borne has been
that of a man whom it needs a great deal
to divert from the straight line of his
duty, I think, I&mdash;I say I think at least&mdash;you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
I mean&mdash;that is you should find in
my elopement a proof&mdash;yes, a proof, Mrs.
Hargrave, of my love for your daughter
and&mdash;and&mdash;an endorsement&mdash;that is, a
guarantee, I mean for&mdash;of&mdash;for our future&mdash;for
her future happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uttering which he threw a damp glance
round the room.</p>

<p>Is that the genuine language of the
heart, thought I? But suppose he <i>had</i>
rehearsed the passage, what other kind of
eloquence than gasps and expletives is to
be expected from a man in his situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought never to have taken place,&#8221;
cried Mrs. Hargrave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mamma!&#8221; exclaimed Conny, &#8220;you
are too severe, we are all to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at her pale face and thought,
&#8220;Ah! She might have had <i>me</i> once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
There would have been no hysterics then.
Nothing but congratulations and new
dresses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">We!</span>&#8221; shrieked my aunt. &#8220;Did <i>I</i> ask
you to elope with Mr. Theodore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake&mdash;!&#8221; interposed my
uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me I should never marry
him with your consent!&#8221; cried Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t!&#8221; broke in my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; shouted my uncle. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
the thing over? what&#8217;s the use of
wrangling? what&#8217;s the use of snapping at
each other like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No use at all,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And what&#8217;s
more&mdash;though I&#8217;m a heretic for saying
so&mdash;in my opinion a woman has a perfect
right to choose for herself the man that
the law compels her to live with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame! shame!&#8221; groaned my aunt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
&#8220;You can&#8217;t mean what you say. Aren&#8217;t
you, too, grossly deceived?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; interrupted Conny, a sudden
blush dyeing her face scarlet. &#8220;Charlie
knew that I didn&#8217;t&mdash;that I couldn&#8217;t love
him&mdash;greatly as I liked him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh! I thought, if you weren&#8217;t a young
bride, if it weren&#8217;t incumbent upon me
to respect your feelings, if it wouldn&#8217;t be
unmanly to deliver myself of my sentiments,
<i>how</i> I could make you writhe.
But I&#8217;ll spare thee, Conny, which I could
not do, had I truly loved thee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conny&#8217;s quite right,&#8221; said I aloud,
&#8220;she never gave me any encouragement,
she always told me she only liked me. I
was very impertinent to dare to have
any hopes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned a look of triumph on her
Theodore. Come, I was a sore point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
anyhow, which was better than being
nothing at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>must</i> we be personal?&#8221; cried
my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> we to talk about if we
mayn&#8217;t speak of this aw&mdash;this dread&mdash;this&mdash;this&mdash;thing?&#8221;
sobbed my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you must excuse me for taking
Charlie into the library,&#8221; said he, rising
and laying hold of my arm. &#8220;I have
many questions to ask him about the
bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Curling looked at us as if he
should cry out, &#8220;For the love of heaven,
don&#8217;t leave me!&#8221; But my uncle took no
notice, and hurriedly walked me out of
the room, not even giving me time to
make a bow to the happy trio I left
behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sick of these squabbles!&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
exclaimed, lighting a candle in the library
and flinging himself into an arm-chair.
&#8220;Sick of these personalities, hints, innuendos,
and aspersions. Oh for the wings
of a dove! Why can&#8217;t my wife leave
them alone? My word is pledged to
them, and she knows it, but is for ever
bursting into our sense of honour with
sharp charges and reckless attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was to be expected,&#8221; said I; &#8220;but
give her time, and she will become inured
to the new state of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as the comfort of my home is
concerned, these rows can&#8217;t last longer
than to-night. To-morrow Curling takes
his wife into lodgings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Small blame to him. He is really to
be pitied. I have heard that mothers-in-law
are bad enough company to live with,
even when they have graced the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
service with their consenting presence,
and sobbed over the bridegroom&#8217;s impossible
promises. But what they are when
their daughters are married in defiance
of them, I can only dimly and fearfully
guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, it is too true. Relations ought
not to live together after they get married.
Deeply offended as I am, I haven&#8217;t
the heart to turn upon the young couple.
Who are we to throw stones? Who are
we to fill the judgment seat? Life
stretches before them; there are, there
must be, many sorrows on the road, and
hard trials, and bitter tears. Whether we
forgive them or not, it is unhappily only
too certain that the future will make
them more than expiate the vexation and
disappointment they have caused us. No,
no! I am not for exacting penances. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
am not for grinding young hearts down
because they have betrayed their owners
into folly. Conny <i>does</i> love that young
man amazingly. I see it in every movement
of her head, in every look she
gives him. He too is very fond of her.
Argue as you will, there was sound
truth in what he just now said. He is
a plodding, mechanical-minded fellow,
devoted to his interests, and a thorough
business-man; and it could be no ordinary
passion that turned his habits awry,
and set him defying fortune for the privilege
of possessing a pretty girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed; for he had no reason to
suppose that you would give Conny a
penny, or that you would allow him to
resume his duties. He is no doubt
sincere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found them in mean lodgings out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of Bloomsbury,&#8221; said my uncle. &#8220;Yet,
miserable as was their accommodation,
and penniless as they avowed themselves to
be, nothing could have induced them
to return with me, but my repeated promises
that they would be kindly received
and forgiven. What a thing is love!&#8221;
he cried, flinging open the window to
get some air. &#8220;Imagine it not only
powerful enough to drive a delicate girl,
who has been coddled all her life, out of
a luxurious country home, into squalid
London lodgings, but to make her perfectly
satisfied with her dirty quarters!
Do you see anything in Mr. Curling to
fall in love with? I&#8217;ll be hanged if I
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, woman&#8217;s caprice is an old song set
to a tune to which men have been
capering for many thousand years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Wasn&#8217;t Eve glad to be turned out of
Paradise? we have only Milton&#8217;s word
for it, that she cried. Conny finds her
Theodore lovely&mdash;and there&#8217;s an end.
Women, like birds, will build their nests
in the queerest places. You can&#8217;t reason
with them. They obey an instinct that
was implanted, in order that the ugliest
man might not be mateless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope my wife is not scolding. She
will make that young man hate her.
And then good-bye to all our chances of
persuading the neighbours that we don&#8217;t
consider the marriage a calamity. What
did you say to her last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him as well as I could remember.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; said he, having listened to
me with great attention, &#8220;she has a
high opinion of you, and I believe, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
a matter of this kind, would rather be
influenced by you than by me. Never
lose an opportunity, like a dear fellow,
to impress upon her that Mr. Curling
is not the shocking bad match she
chooses to think him. He has been
with me four years, and during that
time has behaved himself like a
gentleman. It is all very fine for my
wife to abuse him now; but up to
the moment when she suspected that
he was paying Conny attention, she
professed to like him very much. I
might hunt a long time before I should
find a man better suited for my work
than Curling. And strange as it will
strike you to hear, I can assure you that
when my wife has been trying to
frighten me about him and Conny, I
have thought that he might make my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
child as good a husband as a richer man,
and as my partner be of the greatest
use to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded my head, comprehending
his drift, and admiring his resolution to
view the affair in the brightest light.
This, indeed, was a quality that belonged
in an especial degree to my father&#8217;s family&mdash;my
father himself owning it largely.
I don&#8217;t think anything could have
made <i>him</i> feel degraded. Had a
daughter of his married a sweep, he
would have set to work to trace the
sweep&#8217;s lineage, and not stopped until
he had come to an aristocratic tributary.
His philosophy was to deal with the
events of life, as they befell him,
splendidly; to make misfortune imperial
with the crown of self-complacency;
to distil a kind of essence of dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
out of humiliation, and diffuse the
perfume where another man would
have hidden the sordid rubbish in the
dust-bin of his bosom, and pretended
that there was nothing of the kind on
the premises.</p>

<p>My uncle, who did not possess
my father&#8217;s high self-opinion, allowed
worthier motives to direct him to the
same conduct. I don&#8217;t mean to say
that the hints he had just dropped
of his views regarding Curling were
not owing largely to a wish to make
the best of a bad bargain; but the
wish to see the young people comfortable
and happy, very powerfully
operated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t ask anybody&#8217;s advice,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;upon my treatment of Mr.
Curling; but think awhile, watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
patiently, and act for myself. There is
nothing like acting for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curling shows a proper spirit in determining
not to sleep in this house longer
than a night. He and Conny consented
to return with me on that understanding.
To-morrow morning he will take lodgings
in Updown, and there they will live,
until I furnish them a house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are they to be re-married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see about that to-morrow. The
ceremony must be perfectly private. I
don&#8217;t believe in registrars acting as clergymen.
I would as soon they should
administer the sacrament to me as marry
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here came a feeble knock on the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said my uncle, and Conny
entered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>I gave her a chair, and her papa
said,</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you leave your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is arguing with mamma, and it
makes me miserable to listen to the hard
things she says to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These arguments must be stopped!&#8221;
cried my uncle, leaving his chair. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
your mother leave him alone for to-night?
You&#8217;ll be out of the house to-morrow.
What good can reproaches do? Can they
unmarry you? My wife <i>must</i> be made
to understand this.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he left the room.</p>

<p>Finding myself alone with Conny, I
kicked my feet about a little, and said,
&#8220;I was quite in earnest when I hoped
you would be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you were. But I shall be
happier when you tell me I am forgiven,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
she answered, turning her face away from
the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are forgiven. Your papa
means to&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean forgiven by you,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to forgive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, Charlie. I did not
act honourably. I was not straightforward.
But I couldn&#8217;t&mdash;I <i>dared</i> not be.
I knew if mamma should learn that I
flatly refused to encourage you, she would
contrive to separate me for ever from
Theodore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. I quite understand. I
heartily forgive you&mdash;I bear no resentment.
I <i>was</i> a little surprised&mdash;shocked,
I may say; but the wound is healed,
Conny. I am as sound in health and mind
as if I had never received a stab. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
quite sure that it was all up between
us&mdash;that you hadn&#8217;t, that you never
would have a spark of affection for me,
when you allowed the letter I sent you
from Thistlewood to remain unanswered.
What <i>might</i> have been, my dear, we
needn&#8217;t talk about&mdash;it hasn&#8217;t taken place.
My dream is dreamt out. I have a practical
mind; and being now wide awake,
dismiss the little memory with a smile,
and turn with all kindly wishes and
greetings to the reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was too fond of, too engrossed
with, and by, her husband, to be piqued
by my cool remarks. She was not a flirt&mdash;I
could see that. She had acted the
coquette to suit her own purpose: and
that being served, she had torn up the
mask.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will like Theodore,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
said, earnestly. &#8220;I know you despised
him, but I daresay you were prejudiced,
because you suspected I preferred him
to you. Did you notice that he has
taken off his ring, Charlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has, then; and his hand is wonderfully
improved. Oh, he is so affectionate!
some of these days mamma will
feel heartily ashamed of herself for treating
him so badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt&mdash;but still your mother has
a right to regard your elopement as a
grievance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never would have eloped hadn&#8217;t
mamma prevented Theodore from seeing
me, and set her face so passionately
against our marriage. She forgets that
I have known Theodore for over three
years, and that we have loved each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for two years out of that time. I got
weary, Charlie, of having to meet him
stealthily, and of carrying a heavy secret
about; and I was driven into running
away when I saw how earnestly mamma
was working to bring about my marriage
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One question, Conny; do you remember
one Sunday night leaving me
hurriedly on hearing the clock strike
seven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I went to meet Theodore. Oh,
Charlie, how I hated you for stopping
at home that evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And on that evening I asked you to
marry me!&#8221; I exclaimed, with a laugh
like a groan. &#8220;What fools men sometimes
make of themselves! But never
mind. I&#8217;ve pulled the knife out of my
side&mdash;the wound, I say, is healed. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
is my little folly&mdash;but the farce is played
out, and I am obliged to you for letting
the curtain fall, and turning us all out
before the tragedy began. Let us join
the others. If your husband and I are
to love each other, I mustn&#8217;t begin by
making him jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One word, Charlie&mdash;what do you
think of Theresa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like her very much,&#8221; I answered,
looking into those blue eyes of hers, in
whose depths I had so often sank out of
sight of common sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in love with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; I exclaimed, emphatically.</p>

<p>Quite a bright smile shone in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That confession makes me happy,&#8221;
said she; &#8220;for it satisfies me that I have
not betrayed <i>so very devoted</i> a heart,
after all!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>She opened the door and passed out.</p>

<p>Hush! hark! what was that?</p>

<p>A scream, followed by a gurgle! Good
heavens! my aunt was in hysterics again!
My hat was within reach of my hand;
two strides would take me to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate scenes!&#8221; I whispered, whilst
Conny listened with a pale and frightened
face. &#8220;I have no right to intrude on
domestic troubles. Please apologise for
my sudden departure. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And out I rushed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Frisk.</i> &#8220;Relations aren&#8217;t always welcome: but
a pretty cousin can never come too soon, nor stay
too long.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Vagrant.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> reaching my lodgings, I wrote a
letter to Theresa, in which I gave her
all the news she had asked me for,
and in which also, I am afraid, I
was more jocose on the subject of my
aunt&#8217;s hysterics than a strict sympathy
would have sanctioned. However, the
letter was entirely to my satisfaction,
especially those portions of it in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I referred with proper obscurity to my
feelings.</p>

<p>I then walked with it to the letter-box,
returned, smoked a pipe, and went
to bed, where I meditated without
emotion on Conny, and finally fell asleep
to dream of Theresa.</p>

<p>Next morning, whilst I was at breakfast,
my uncle drove up to the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; said he, on entering my
sitting-room, &#8220;my wife has an idea, and
I want to talk it over with you. But
get on with your breakfast&mdash;don&#8217;t let
me disturb you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the idea, uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decent lodgings are not to be got
in Updown,&#8221; he answered, looking around
the room inquisitively; &#8220;my wife went
everywhere before she settled upon these
for you. But this appears a thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
comfortable house, with a very presentable
and respectable exterior. Indeed
it is a house fit for any lady or
gentleman to live in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That it is. It&#8217;s detached, you see,
with nothing sordid on either side.
The garden in front gives us a landed
appearance. Nor are there any black-beetles,
rats, or fleas on the premises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is a very great deal in
its favour. However, what I have
called to ask you, is, will you let
Curling and Conny have these rooms
for the present?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the greatest pleasure,&#8221; I answered,
promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, my boy, and you will
live with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have any right to
trouble you,&#8221; I replied, scarcely relishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the boundless prospect of arguments,
reproaches, tears, and hysterics, which
my uncle&#8217;s suggestion opened up to
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense. You don&#8217;t think I
would ask you to give up your rooms
without finding you other accommodation?
Conny&#8217;s old bed-room shall
be prepared for you&mdash;it is the second
best in the house. Is it settled?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was settled with <i>him</i>, I could see;
objections would only make me appear
ill-natured; and as it was out of my power
to state any reasons for declining his
hospitality, I consented with a mind
agitated by misgivings.</p>

<p>The landlady was then summoned, and
after my uncle had been shown over the
house, the proposed change was told her.
My vanity was not a little flattered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the good lady&#8217;s evident reluctance to
part with me. My distinctive virtue was
no doubt negative&mdash;I gave her no trouble.
She raised her terms when she heard that
a lady was to take my place, but this my
uncle did not object to. So she was desired
to get her rooms ready that afternoon
for the reception of her new lodgers,
and my uncle and I then started for the
bank.</p>

<p>On the road he asked me what had
made me hurry away, the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;My aunt&#8217;s screams,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;My
nerves disappear when a woman cries. I
hope she is well this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moody, terribly moody. I very much
fear that she will never be able to get
over her prejudice against Curling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have a kind of home of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
own,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and I suppose before long
you&#8217;ll furnish a house for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that I must do as soon as possible,
if only for the sake of appearances. It
would never do for people to say &#8216;Hargrave&#8217;s
daughter is in lodgings. Depend
upon it, Hargrave is not the substantial
man we have thought him or he would
never allow his child to live so meanly.&#8217;
A hint of this kind started by the first
malicious person it occurred to, would
run through the town, and ultimately,
perhaps, injure the bank; for people
naturally would object to trust their
money to a man who, if he is too poor to
assist his daughter, must be obviously
living beyond his means by residing in
such a house as mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>I quite appreciated this reasoning, which
nevertheless had, I was persuaded, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
whatever to do with his real motives.
The fact was, he <i>felt</i> he had no business
to forgive Conny too readily and make
her as comfortable as if she had married
with his full consent. But as, in spite
of his conscience, he <i>had</i> forgiven her,
and as he had determined, in defiance of
his sense of justice, that she <i>should</i> be
comfortable, there was nothing for him
to do but to mask his fine instincts with
worldly considerations, and pretend to
find the inspiration of his kindness
in the fear of gossip.</p>

<p>On reaching the bank, he was detained
for some time in consultation with a
client. When released, he told me he
was now going to call on the rector
to see about getting Conny married
properly; and away he trudged, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a broiling sun, agitated, and energetic,
and looking worried to death.</p>

<p>Ah, Eugenio, these are some of the
little troubles people have to put up
with who take wives and raise families.
No doubt, if we had our way, we should
marry our daughters to dukes, and our
sons to maids of honour. But our
children, most of us find, have their
own original theories upon the subject of
matrimony; and, as they are our masters
and mistresses, what are we to do but
to submit? follow them humbly, hat in
hand? blubber our congratulations over
the marriages contrived by themselves,
and illustrate, by our meek faces, how
sensible we are that we were put upon
this earth for no other purpose than to
make handsome settlements, welcome the
poor and needy into our family circles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
order wedding-breakfasts and bridesmaids&#8217;
lockets, fiddlers and waiters, champagne
and carriages, that the events we deprecate
may be celebrated with all proper
magnificence? and, finally, half beggar
ourselves to furnish those houses which
we are never afterwards to enter without
being made to feel that, &#8220;papa and
mamma <i>do</i> interfere so?&#8221;</p>

<p>My poor uncle returned to the bank
a little before four o&#8217;clock, covered with
dust and perspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; he gasped, sinking into a
chair, &#8220;never whilst I live may I be
called upon to do such a day&#8217;s work
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I listened to the catalogue of his
performances with mingled emotions of
astonishment and sympathy.</p>

<p>He had seen the rector, and arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
for a private service to take place on
Monday.</p>

<p>He had then gone to Grove End,
where he had found his wife, and
Conny, and Curling, arguing furiously,
the ladies in tears, had seized upon his
son-in-law, borne him off to my old
lodgings, and desired him to stop there
to superintend the getting ready of the
apartments.</p>

<p>He had again driven to Grove End,
ordered Conny to get together the things
she wanted, presided over the packing,
meanwhile keeping his wife at bay by
every species of entreaty, supplication,
dehortation, and even menace, until
Conny was ready, when the trunks
were hoisted into the phaeton, and off
they started for Updown.</p>

<p>Nor did my uncle&#8217;s labours cease with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
this; for judging that amid the excitement,
heat, and confusion of the hour,
Curling would entirely lose sight of his
own and his wife&#8217;s domestic needs, he had
performed a tour of the shops, whence he
had sent to them wine, poultry, groceries&mdash;in
short, everything he in his dizziness
could think of, finally arriving at the
bank in the condition I have just described;
though not to find rest yet. For,
scarcely was his panting narrative concluded,
when in came a client&mdash;one of
those thick-headed, dull-minded farmers,
who spell their names thus: +, and
grin as they pronounce themselves no
scholards; who, taking a seat, with his
hat between his legs, began in a tongue
turbid with Z&#8217;s, to demonstrate some
mental difficulty he was labouring under
with regard to a bill which, his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
having died since it came into his
possession, he had nobody now to read
to him; and his memory being weak,
could not recollect the date, the sum, or
the conditions.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; I exclaimed to my
uncle just before leaving the bank,
&#8220;what has become of my clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All your things are packed up,
and gone to Grove End.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who packed them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The landlady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All my papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything belonging to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just go and have a look round,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>You will understand my uneasiness,
when I tell you that, besides several
letters I had written to Theresa, none of
which had satisfied me, though I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
not destroyed them, there were various
hints for, and beginnings of, poems in
the drawer of my dressing-table, which
I would not have had Conny read for a
very great deal. Suppose these poetical
fragments were satires referring to the
false and fickle Being whose initials were
&#8220;C. H.:&#8221; now changed to &#8220;C. C.?&#8221;
Suppose they were nothing of the kind?
The most candid biographer is permitted
to keep something back from the eye of
a discerning public: and the contents
of that dressing-table drawer are my
secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make haste,&#8221; said my uncle: &#8220;I&#8217;ll
wait for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Off I started, not at all liking to
intrude upon the young people, but
resolute to save my papers. To my
great relief, I found they had gone out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
for a walk, leaving directions with the
landlady to have a chicken cooked by
six o&#8217;clock. Likewise a pair of soles,
and a cherry-pie.</p>

<p>I rushed up-stairs, and found&mdash;what I
had expected: all my papers! What a
narrow escape! Let me sit down, and
take breath. But perhaps Conny had
already peeped at them? Avaunt, odious
thought! With eager hands I rolled
them into a bundle, stared about me to
see that no further memorial of mine
encumbered the room, and then returned
to the bank.</p>

<p>You may guess my amazement, when,
on entering my uncle&#8217;s house at Grove
End, I beheld in the hall an intimately
familiar white hat, standing upon the
table, and by its side, a lady&#8217;s parasol,
and a travelling-bag.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; I exclaimed, grasping
my uncle&#8217;s arm: &#8220;do you know
whose hat that is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick&#8217;s!&#8221; cried my uncle, and pushed
open the drawing-room door.</p>

<p>What made my heart to beat when I
saw thee, Theresa?</p>

<p>She and her papa left my aunt, and
met us half-way.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Dick?&#8221; &#8220;How are
you, Tom?&#8221; &#8220;This <i>is</i> kind of you,
Theresa!&#8221; &#8220;Delighted to see you,
Charlie!&#8221; &#8220;What a blow! when did
you come?&#8221; &#8220;How unexpected! where
is Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>These greetings having been got
through, we all sat down, I close alongside
of Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a real pleasure,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Did
you get my letter?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, and answered it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the one I posted last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We left before the mid-day
post arrived. Papa thought we couldn&#8217;t
do less than run over to Grove End and
see how you were all enduring your
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I look crushed?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I thinner, do you think? do
I appear wasted? are my cheeks hollow,
and is there anything approaching a
broken-hearted expression in my eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look very well. I wish I could
say as much for poor aunt. Troubles of
this kind seem to agree with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And how well and how handsome <i>she</i>
was looking! how her fine eyes glittered!
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;though this trouble
hasn&#8217;t disagreed with me, I feel very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
much for the father and mother. How
long are you going to stop here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We return to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very much disgusted if
you do,&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what does Theresa mean by
sitting in her hat?&#8221; cried uncle Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have only been here ten minutes,&#8221;
answered his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, take off your hat,&#8221; said
my aunt, leaving the sofa, with her eyes
inflamed by tears. &#8220;Come up-stairs
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t mean to stay,&#8221; answered
Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will, and you&#8217;ll sleep here,
too,&#8221; exclaimed uncle Tom.</p>

<p>This observation provoked an argument
which ended in Theresa&#8217;s defeat
and departure with her aunt up-stairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>&#8220;I was never more amazed than when
I read Charlie&#8217;s letter,&#8221; said uncle Dick.
&#8220;The wife bears it badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very badly,&#8221; groaned uncle Tom.
&#8220;In fact she is the great difficulty now.
Grieved and upset as I first was, I could
very soon get used to the thing, if my
wife would only stop crying and storming.
Of course, Curling is a wretched
match for my child, and the elopement
makes the whole affair confoundedly
humiliating. But it has its bright side.
Curling is a first-rate clerk, and, as my
son-in-law, can render himself invaluable
to me as a right-hand man. Conny is
devoted to him, and I have no doubt
he&#8217;ll prove a good husband. If my
wife would only view the matter a
little cheerfully, it would lose half its
gloom.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a confounded upset,&#8221; said Dick:
&#8220;but you are perfectly right to look at
it cheerfully. My philosophy, when a
bad thing happens, is, to think that it
might have been worse, like the Dutchman
in the &#8216;Spectator,&#8217; who, on breaking
his leg, thanked God it wasn&#8217;t his
neck. What have you done with the
young people?&#8221;</p>

<p>This question brought about a long
and minute narrative, which was barely
finished when my aunt and cousin returned.</p>

<p>You may conceive that nothing but
Conny and her elopement was talked
about till dinner was announced. My
aunt was still most violent and irascible
in her views and opinions, nor was her
temper improved by her giving occasion
more than once to her husband to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
her to order. Uncle Dick hardly remembered
Curling: and Theresa had never
seen him; and from the description my
aunt gave of the young man, I believe
they were both prepared to be introduced
to the most ugly, insignificant,
vulgar specimen of human nature that
ever afflicted the eyesight.</p>

<p>Fortunately, during dinner, the presence
of the servants prevented us from
discussing the elopement: and, to my
great satisfaction, we were allowed to
converse on topics that bore no reference
whatever to Curling or to Conny.</p>

<p>I sat next to Theresa, and never felt
happier. Over and over again I caught
my aunt watching me, with a most
melancholy expression in her eyes, as if
she witnessed in my undissembled enjoyment
of Theresa&#8217;s society, the dissolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the last fragment that remained of her
pretty hopes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said uncle Dick, when the
dessert was upon the table, and the servants
had left the room, &#8220;I should like
to see Conny. She would take it ill
were I to go away without wishing her
joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll walk to Updown after dinner,&#8221;
replied uncle Tom. &#8220;A kindly word is a
great help to a young heart, isn&#8217;t it,
Dick? and God forbid that I should prevent
my girl winning what love she can
at a time when the want of love would
be bitter to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to go too, papa,&#8221;
said Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so should I,&#8221; observed the Hero
of this story.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think too many of us would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
embarrass them,&#8221; answered Tom. &#8220;You
will see her to-morrow, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we leave to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father may if he likes; but
you shan&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Tom warmly.
&#8220;We want a cheerful face among us,
Teazer; and it will be a god-send to
our spirits if you will stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She shall stop,&#8221; said her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, certainly, she must stop,&#8221;
observed my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no right to invite anybody,&#8221;
said I: &#8220;but if my uncle wishes, I
shall be happy to prevent Theresa from
leaving by mounting guard at the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a pistol?&#8221; said uncle Dick.</p>

<p>I burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought no dresses with
me,&#8221; said Theresa, blushing and glancing
at me with a sly look of mirth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>&#8220;Give me a list and I&#8217;ll send you
all you want,&#8221; exclaimed her papa.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who will look after you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Myself, to be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut! tut! let us have no more
discussion. Of course Theresa stops with
us,&#8221; cried uncle Tom. &#8220;There is Conny&#8217;s
bed-room&mdash;oh, I forgot! Charlie has that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No he hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Any room
but that will suit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two brothers exchanged meaning
glances. I knew very well what was in
their minds, but not the shadow, not
the ghost of a protest arose from my
soul. As Theresa wasn&#8217;t going to see
Conny, I did not press my society upon
my uncles; so it ended in their leaving
the house after dinner, whilst my aunt,
Theresa, and your servant remained at
home to look after one another.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>My aunt could talk of nothing but
the dreadful blow Conny had dealt her
pride, and the wretched person she had
introduced into the family. I am very
patient, and have never in my life been
considered unsympathetic: but upon my
word, I began to grow very sick of
hearing my aunt twanging, eternally
twanging, that one groaning string.
Having fruitlessly endeavoured to get her
to talk of something else, I began to
cast about for some stratagem to induce
her to leave my cousin and me alone.
However, to my great delight, she burst
into tears in the middle of a violent
attack on Curling, and, probably feeling
hysterical, and not choosing to show her
ankles to Theresa, she hastened out of
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very sad,&#8221; said Theresa.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8220;To everybody,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;to
those who have to feel and to those
who have to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t conceive how my aunt could
have been so completely tricked. Surely
she must have known that Conny was
attached to Mr. Curling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have all been made fools of,&#8221; I
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider that you have been the
worst treated,&#8221; she said, with a little
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I can&#8217;t imagine anything more
mortifying than to be jilted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Theresa, you are labouring
under an afflicting delusion. I have not
been jilted. I don&#8217;t say I have been
well treated; for Conny ought never to
have permitted me to express my admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
for her face&mdash;an admiration,&#8221; I
added, emphatically, gazing at her,
steadily, &#8220;which I still preserve, <i>absolutely</i>
indifferent as she is to me&mdash;she
ought never to have encouraged me, I
say, when she was all the time engaged
to her clerk. But I have observed,
several times, and will repeat the observation
once more, that I forgive her. I
forgive her entirely&mdash;without reservation&mdash;<i>sans
arrière pensée</i>&mdash;which, I take it
upon myself to say, would be impossible
had I ever loved her. You would be
amazed were you to know with what
cold-blooded unconcern I received the
news of her elopement. My sympathy
was for her parents; not a pang of
any kind or description visited me for
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay she knew how completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
you mistook your feelings.... Shall
we go into the grounds. This room is
very close.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; said I, and forth
we strolled.</p>

<p>A warm August evening it was, but
not untempered with cool draughts of
air, which stirred the flowers from time
to time and set the stray hairs about
Theresa&#8217;s forehead dancing.</p>

<p>I admired her more than ever I had
admired Conny. My admiration for our
golden cousin had been immediate, but
it had attained its full growth at once
and never afterwards increased. It was
otherwise with Theresa. I had begun by
detesting her. Afterwards, when I found
her womanly, the pleasure I had taken
in watching her gained a new force day
by day; and now, on this calm evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
I found myself regarding her in a manner
which, but that it was qualified by the
profound compliment that glistened in
my eyes, she might have thought highly
impertinent.</p>

<p>What we talked about as we strolled
to and fro, I almost forget. I have a
faint recollection of some unwilling
laughter being wrung from her by my
reference to the reception she had vouchsafed
me at Thistlewood, and by a
somewhat comical description of the
state of my mind on that day and on
the night that followed. I can also
recall that she made various efforts to
prove me fickle because of the change
that had come over me respecting Conny,
charges which I believe I rebutted with
considerable ingenuity, considering that
I was obliged to be sophistical to clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
myself, and that she was extremely shrewd
and logical in her reasoning. Further
I can recollect that I was impressed with
the idea that she found much pleasure in
my society. I said to her &#8220;It is an
understood thing that you are to remain
for some time at Grove End.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not come here with that intention,&#8221;
she answered, &#8220;but if my
company is likely to be of use to my
aunt, it is my duty to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for me as well as for my aunt.
My spirits want cheering up. You don&#8217;t
consider them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! you are happy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At this moment; but leave us, and
then see where my spirits will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here universal darkness covers all, and
nothing survives of the rest of that walk
and talk but the memory of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
blush, the smile, the wise shake of the
head, and the expressive silence that
followed my observation.</p>

<p>We had been chatting with my aunt
(whom we found in the drawing-room)
for some twenty minutes, when my
uncles entered.</p>

<p>Dick went up to his sister-in-law and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all anxiety to hear how Conny
is, aren&#8217;t you? My dear, she is very
well, very happy, and sent you her love.
Are you aware that you are committing
a dreadful mistake in abusing her husband?
I can assure you I never wish
to meet with a smarter-minded man.
Why, I had made up my mind to be
introduced to some coarse, country bumpkin;
instead of which, Teazer,&#8221; addressing
his daughter, &#8220;I was received by a gentlemanly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
youth with fine intelligent eyes,
and very modest manners, who detained
me for ten minutes with as shrewd a
piece of reasoning on our commercial
relations with Austria as ever I could
wish to read in a newspaper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; said uncle Tom, looking
round him, with a broad smile, and
addressing everybody. &#8220;Dick has taken
a great fancy to the young fellow&mdash;and
give me Dick&#8217;s opinion before anybody&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a fig about his ideas of
Austria,&#8221; cried my aunt, hotly. &#8220;I only
feel that to my dying day I shall deplore
the marriage as a heavy disgrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my word you are wilful!&#8221;
retorted Dick, with equal warmth. &#8220;Disgrace!
I&#8217;ll tell you what&mdash;had Theresa
fallen in love with Curling, she should
have married him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>Theresa smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how are you going to get over
the elopement?&#8221; called out my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;By forgetting it!&#8221; replied the other.
&#8220;Who cares about an elopement?&#8221; he
added, contemptuously. &#8220;In my young
days we were all of us running away
with one another. Love was then a
passion worth feeling&mdash;a smart, adventurous,
dashing emotion, fed with
stronger waters than the tea and negus
you now give it; a heroical combination
of enraged fathers and moonlit nights,
postchaises and turnpikes, cloaks and
swoons, brandy and bliss. I don&#8217;t mean
to say that Curling had any right to
walk off with your daughter in that
manner; but since he <i>did</i>, give him the
credit of having spirit. My dear woman,
I really expected to meet some wretched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
shrivelled mannikin, a poor fool with
about fourpennyworth of soul in his
composition, on no account to be
introduced to your friends, and whom
you were to hope would, at your
evening parties, be mistaken for a waiter.
Instead, my admiration is challenged by
a gentleman, and my anticipative contempt
converted into honest gratulations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick is no humbug,&#8221; said his
brother, looking into his wife&#8217;s dogged
face, &#8220;and if he saw anything in
Curling to despise he&#8217;d say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right out,&#8221; responded Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curling possesses a thorough knowledge
of business,&#8221; I observed, thinking
it incumbent upon me to say something
in the youth&#8217;s praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;How Thomas can so easily forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that double-dealing cashier of his, is
horribly puzzling!&#8221; cried his wife; &#8220;for
my part&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you have me do?&#8221;
interrupted Thomas. &#8220;Suppose the bargain
a bad one: is that a reason for
making the worst of it? I <i>don&#8217;t</i> forgive
him for running away with Conny: I
consider that in doing so he was guilty
of gross impertinence. But can I
unmarry them? Teach me how, and I&#8217;ll
make them single to-morrow. But since
you can&#8217;t, and I can&#8217;t; since they are
as utterly man and wife as you and I,
what&#8217;s the use of storming and raging?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; exclaimed uncle Dick, with
deep emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;My argument,&#8221; continued Tom, &#8220;is,
let us strive to make them comfortable&mdash;let
us endeavour to find something in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
this unfortunate affair to qualify our
disappointment and to teach us to believe
that, as it has happened, it has happened
for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sound philosophy!&#8221; cried Dick as
triumphantly as if the speech had been
his; &#8220;and worth more than the loudest
shrieks with which human lungs could
pierce the ear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, <i>you</i> can talk,&#8221; exclaimed my aunt,
&#8220;but there sits your daughter&mdash;safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so safe as you think,&#8221; he answered
turning shortly round and confronting
his daughter and me, who sat
unnecessarily close together.</p>

<p>Theresa didn&#8217;t change colour, but I
flushed beautifully, I can promise you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curling begins afresh at the bank
to-morrow,&#8221; said uncle Tom to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221; I answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
grateful to him for diverting the general
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they dine with us to-morrow,&#8221;
he added, addressing his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very proper,&#8221; broke in his brother;
&#8220;and were it not for my rooted dislike
to leave my house at the mercy of my
servants, nothing would give me greater
pleasure than to drink to their future
happiness in a bumper of the best champagne
you&#8217;ve got in your cellar. However,
I&#8217;ll tell you what I mean to do,
Tom, and I say it in the presence of
witnesses, since it is a verbal agreement;
when they have chosen a house I&#8217;ll
furnish it for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papa, you shall,&#8221; said Theresa.</p>

<p>My aunt hung her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I never set foot in this room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
again Tom, if I don&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed uncle
Dick with great energy. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t I
Conny&#8217;s uncle? and what&#8217;s the use of
uncles if they don&#8217;t make presents? I
like that young Curling, and mean to
stick to him. Let him go and order
what furniture he wants and send the
bill in to me. Pooh! pooh! don&#8217;t interrupt,
Tom. Curling has nothing against
him that I can see, but his poverty; and
if I choose to help him to furnish a house
for his wife, you&#8217;ll not have so much
reason to deplore the marriage in a
pecuniary sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is my place to furnish their
house,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>His brother said it wasn&#8217;t, and Theresa
said it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>My aunt proved that it was nobody&#8217;s
place but Curling&#8217;s.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;And Curling shall do it&mdash;through
me,&#8221; said Dick.</p>

<p>A hot argument followed, which ended
in my aunt bursting into tears, and in my
uncle Tom wringing his brother&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>All this was sufficiently pleasant, and
even my aunt grew more cheerful as
the evening wore away. I heartily
applauded uncle Dick&#8217;s untiring efforts
to render the poor mother satisfied with
her child&#8217;s choice. Suppose he was not
so much in earnest as he seemed? so
much the more praise is due to him.
It is very easy to sneer, very easy to
render people dissatisfied and wretched.
(You can tell that by the number of
stupid persons whom that sort of work
gives employment to.) And detestable
as Rochefoucauld&#8217;s philosophy always is,
there is but too much truth in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
assertion, that there is something in the
misfortunes of our friends that seldom
fails to please us. I honoured uncle
Dick for the cheerful light his large
kind heart streamed upon this family
trouble. He talked so well, reasoned so
clearly and honestly, that it was difficult
to hear him and not consider that
Conny had shown profound sagacity in
selecting Curling for a husband; and
that this alliance, so far from being a
disgrace, was an affair which all Conny&#8217;s
relations had every right to regard with
emotions of ungovernable pride.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2></div>



<p class="center">&#8220;Wounds, Dolly! this marrying be dear work!&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap"><i>Doves in a Cage.</i></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Curling</span> was at his post next morning
when I reached the bank. Marriage
seemed to agree with him, for he looked
uncommonly well. He greeted me
nervously, but his embarrassment speedily
fell before my cordial manner. Was I
going to be haughty and distant? No,
indeed! Infinitely more should I have
preferred a good kicking to his suspicion
that I was mortified by his triumph, and
hated him because he had won Conny&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
love. Good heavens! Wasn&#8217;t he welcome
to it? He began to mumble something
in my ear about a regret that his and
Conny&#8217;s stratagem should have involved
my feelings&mdash;but I cut him very short.
No doubt Conny had instructed him in
this apology, and I silenced him bluntly,
expressly that she might learn how
distasteful to me was all reference to
distressing folly.</p>

<p>He smiled feebly and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon; I wouldn&#8217;t have
alluded to the subject had I not thought
an explanation was due.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;and now
about Mr. Acorn&#8217;s promissory note?&#8221; And
so the matter ended.</p>

<p>My uncle&#8217;s greeting to him was very
gentle. He asked tenderly after Conny,
and whether she was going to Grove End<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
during the morning. Curling replied
that as they were to dine there, he did
not believe she would start before him.
They then retired into the back office and
left me to think of Theresa.</p>

<p>Now that <i>she</i> was at Grove End, it
was delightful to feel that my residence,
too, was there. I was very much in love
with her, and what was strange, I could
hug this passion without in any sense
feeling that I was exhibiting surprising
weakness in so speedily yielding to a new
fascination whilst the corpse of the old
one was still warm.</p>

<p>Not being a Scotchman, I am incapable
of going into the metaphysics of
this thing. However, I may point out
that there was some difference between
the love I had felt for Conny and the
love that I now felt for Theresa. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
begin with, I deny that I ever <i>did</i> love
Conny. Oh yes, you may turn back to
other chapters and point me out several
most condemnatory phrases; but don&#8217;t
judge people by phrases. There is only
one alphabet, but there are a hundred
passions; and admiration will express
itself in the language of love, precisely as
if it were the most perfect and enduring
devotion.</p>

<p>I had loved Conny for her face and
figure. <i>Voilà tout.</i> She had not one
intellectual charm, that I can remember,
to fascinate me. Reading her character
in the light thrown upon it by her elopement,
I found, let me tell you, a very
great deal that was decidedly objectionable.
This was enough to confirm my
indifference.</p>

<p>Now it was quite otherwise with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Theresa. I won&#8217;t pretend that I didn&#8217;t
immensely admire her handsome face,
and fine eyes, and noble figure, and that
they were not the first cause of my
loving her. But during my stay at
Thistlewood, I had discovered many
qualities in her which, had I not been
influenced in a great measure by Conny,
would have settled the question there
and then, and dismissed me to Updown
as much in love as ever man was. It
was enough that Conny should turn out
a regular little trickster, who had trifled
with my feelings merely to fool me at
last, to send my thoughts trooping to
Theresa. Here was a foil upon which
her fine qualities of head and heart
could not fail to glisten brightly. Long
before had the memory of her eccentric
reception of me been transmuted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the alchemy of admiration into a
pungent and a piquant reminiscence;
so <i>that</i> could not deform my opinion of
her. Here, then, my love was based
upon altogether different ground from
that on which I had built my first
and unsubstantial passion. There were
physical graces to charm me; there
were mental characteristics to fascinate
me. A love was now inspired that
was every day to gain greater strength;
and thus I could start on my new
amatory career with a conviction that,
whether I should win Theresa&#8217;s love or
not, my devotion would never be met
with a heartless betrayal.</p>

<p>I never left the bank to return to
Grove End with more pleasure than I
did on that day. Uncle Dick had
returned to Thistlewood by the mid-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
train, and I found Theresa thoroughly
domiciled, sitting at the open drawing-room
window with some work in her
hand. A bright look lighted up her
face when she saw me.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will Conny be here?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very shortly, I expect. How have
you been amusing yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt and I went for a drive this
afternoon,&#8221; she answered, laying down
her work, and joining me on the lawn.
&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t uncle Tom returned with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He remained behind with the phaeton
to drive the turtle doves over,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;The truth is, he wants Updown to see
him and them together. We all stand
in awe of gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt is much more reasonable than
she was last evening,&#8221; exclaimed Theresa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
&#8220;The talking-to Papa gave her has done
her no harm. She is, I think, slowly
beginning to see that her husband&#8217;s view
is the soundest, and that Conny might
have done a very great deal worse, though
she might also have done a very great
deal better. Mothers are nearly always
the last to come round in these matters.
I wonder why?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps because they have more to
do with their daughters than the papas
have, and therefore the daughters&#8217; mistakes
touch them more nearly. That&#8217;s
only one reason&mdash;and no reason at all.
Women&mdash;I don&#8217;t say all women&mdash;no, no,
Theresa, not all&mdash;are not very liberal in
their views of life or of each other.
Mothers and daughters are no exception.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right. Women are
not liberal-minded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In many things they are, and,
queerly enough, in directions where men
are bigoted. But in matters of dress
and sentiment, they are often prodigiously
intolerant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Having been deceived by a girl,&#8221;
said she, with a sweet laugh, &#8220;it is
perfectly fair that you should <i>have at</i> the
whole sex.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray,&#8221; I entreated earnestly, &#8220;pray
don&#8217;t refer to that piece of folly. Had
I met you before I met Conny, it never
could have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>She curtsied, perhaps to hide a little
blush; and then asked me if I had ridden
since my return from Thistlewood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had time yet: but I shall
hope to do so frequently now that you
are here. And we&#8217;ll have some pistol-shooting
too, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Papa objects, so I mean to give
up the unmaidenly pastime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very dutiful. Perhaps, on
the whole, it <i>is</i> rather unmaidenly,
especially when you take aim at
sober-minded and meditative young
gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I <i>never</i> to be allowed to forget
my nonsense!&#8221; she exclaimed, looking
annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And am I never to be allowed to
forget mine?&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
enter into an agreement with you,
Theresa, never to remind you of <i>your</i>
nonsense, if you will promise never to
remind me of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So then, my wrong-headed <i>penchant</i>
for Conny is to be forgotten as if no such
a thing had ever been?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll do my best to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you will never see
anything to like in me until you <i>do</i>
forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; she asked,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No girl can possibly have any respect
or regard for a man she considers
a flirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you <i>will</i> have your theories
about your sex, it is better, for your
peace of mind, that they should not
be contradicted.... Here&#8217;s the
phaeton!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, there it was, Conny next the
coachman, Curling and his <i>beau-père</i>
behind.</p>

<p>The two cousins kissed each other
profusely&mdash;in short, as only young
girls <i>can</i> kiss. Nothing could surpass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Theresa&#8217;s gracefully cordial reception
of little Conny, and her polite greeting
to Mr. Curling. Conny looked bewitchingly
pretty. She gave me her hand
and smiled at me with her eyes. Ah,
my child, those smiles can&#8217;t affect me
now. Don your loveliest airs, strike
your most irresistible attitude, you would
find in me an unmoved spectator.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My love is dead,</div>
<div class="verse">Gone to his death-bed.</div>
</div></div>

<p>I can watch you as one at a puppet-show.
Tender is the tint of your cheeks,
heavenly the azure of your eyes, snow-like
your pearly teeth; but to me, my
dear, you are no more than a cunning
contrivance of beauty; the sweetest
dummy, from which I can turn away
with the lightest sigh, to think that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
could ever have been so weak as to
bestow a thought upon you.</p>

<p>She left us to seek her mamma, and
then we got talking, as people not
absolutely at their ease will talk&mdash;about
the weather. Theresa was admirably
lady-like in her manner to Mr. Curling.
The poor fellow was a good deal embarrassed,
but all things considered acquitted
himself very tolerably.</p>

<p>My uncle watched his niece narrowly.
He evidently wanted her good opinion
for his son-in-law, and smiled with
ghastly approval every time the young
man spoke.</p>

<p>I caught Curling regarding her with
great admiration, and even awe; which
put me into the best possible temper
with him, so pleased was I that he
should see what a splendid substitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
fortune had provided me with in the
room of the young lady he had
married.</p>

<p>The trying moment presently came,
when my aunt stepped out of the house,
followed by Conny. Theresa and I fell
back with the instinctive horror of
people of sensibility who apprehend a
shock. However, nothing very disagreeable
happened. There was something,
indeed, unpleasantly chilling in the hard
smile with which my aunt gave Curling
her hand and in the hasty manner with
which she withdrew it; but the effect,
to us lookers-on at least, was somewhat
qualified by the broad, nervous smile
with which my uncle superintended the
greeting.</p>

<p>As for Curling, his politeness was
cringing. He smiled if his mother-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
turned her head, listened with painful
eagerness to be agreeable if she
opened her mouth, agreed with her
before he well knew what she had said,
and in every respect showed himself
thoroughly afraid of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he is going the right
way to work to make her respect him,&#8221;
I whispered to Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow!&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I
wonder Conny had the heart to bring
him here. I should be sorry to subject
my husband to such treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems gentlemanly enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you have run off with him,
Theresa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon with O&#8217;Twist!&#8221;</p>

<p>I had made up my mind to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Conny given me to take into dinner;
but to my great relief and pleasure, she
took her papa&#8217;s arm, Curling conducted
Mrs. Hargrave, and I was left to
Theresa. Curling and his mother-in-law
walked in front of us from the drawing-room,
and I had great difficulty to
retrain myself from bursting into a fit
of laughter on catching sight of my
aunt&#8217;s face, and watching the contemptuous
air with which she waddled alongside
her new connexion. Theresa
begged me not to speak to her, lest
she should lose her self-control. The
sight was, indeed, ludicrous enough;
and one of the servants, at all events,
saw the joke, for she turned rapidly
away as my aunt entered the dining-room
and emitted a laugh over the sideboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
which made my uncle look
smartly round under the impression, I
believe, that a cork had flown.</p>

<p>The dinner was not a very lively
affair. Nothing but the having Theresa
at my side saved me from wishing
myself a hundred miles away. In vain
my uncle strove to be cheerful; in vain
he told his best stories; in vain he
indulged in little flirting allusions to
matrimony, and winked out, so to
speak, those little modest jokes which
are universally held to be permissible
on the occasion of the presence of a
newly married couple. God knows no
man ever tried to laugh more resolutely
than I did; but my hoarse notes were
as destitute of mirth as a raven&#8217;s
croak. Had I wept I should have
shown myself more sympathetic; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
my uncle&#8217;s humour tottered on the very
verge of tears.</p>

<p>Theresa did all she could: tried her
relations on twenty different subjects,
then out of sheer weariness took refuge
in silence.</p>

<p>Curling was so nervous, he could
scarcely eat. I felt for him&mdash;yes, my
whole heart went out to him&mdash;when he
knocked a wine-glass full of claret over
the table-cloth. The wine wasn&#8217;t redder
than his face, I promise you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother,&#8221; said my uncle, seeing
the poor fellow spoon the wine up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sprinkle some salt over it,&#8221; said
Conny, looking abject.</p>

<p>It was plain to everybody that Theodore
had been scarcely able to handle
his knife and fork for nervousness, that
though he might have known how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
behave with perfect propriety, fear of
his mother-in-law bereft him of his knowledge
and hurried him into <i>grossièretés</i>.
For instance, he refused to begin until
the others were helped; insisted upon
passing whatever was set before him to
Mrs. Hargrave; eat up his bread in a
trice and hopelessly entangled himself
in a wild complication of knives, forks,
spoons, and glasses. I doubt if he would
have committed a single blunder had
my aunt been absent. Ah, Eugenio,
<i>you</i> know what it is to have a mother-in-law
watching you with a foregone
prejudice of the bitterest kind rankling
in her eyes. I know a young man
whom his mother-in-law made so
anxious and apprehensive that, before
dinner was over, he had kicked both his
boots off under the table, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
have joined the ladies in his socks had
not a good-natured footman directed his
attention to the state of his feet.</p>

<p>Tears were in Conny&#8217;s eyes before the
dessert was brought in; and I felt so
heartily sorry for the poor girl and her
yet more-to-be-pitied husband, that addressing
my uncle, I exclaimed,</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we going to drink to the
happiness of the bride and bridegroom?&#8221;
hoping that the hearty expression of our
good wishes would render them happier
and force some of the acidity out of my
aunt&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>We then filled our glasses and all
spoke at once, to the effect that the
young people would enjoy a long life
and unbounded happiness: Theresa
speaking very feelingly and my aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
nodding her head with a face that
expressed everything but the prevailing
sentiment.</p>

<p>Now I really believe this toast would
have ended in putting us all into a
better temper, had well been let alone;
for even as we drank, Conny smiled and
looked much gratified.</p>

<p>But judge my surprise, when, after an
interval of not less than five minutes,
I observed Mr. Curling, who had been
pulling at his watchguard in a fashion
that threatened to tear the waistcoat off
his back, rise, and in rising knock his
chair over, which however, nobody
offered to pick up, that he might not
be interrupted. In a very faint and
difficult voice, he thanked us for our
good wishes, which, he particularly
desired his mother-in-law to believe, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
should strive his utmost to deserve.
He next informed us that he was never
considered a good speaker, and that if
he didn&#8217;t express all the gratitude he
felt, it was not because he didn&#8217;t feel
it, but because he hadn&#8217;t the words.</p>

<p>Here I hoped he would sit down. But
there are two notorious difficulties in
public and unpremeditated speaking, of
which every nervous man who has ever
got upon his legs is but too keenly sensible:
the first difficulty is to know how
to begin, and the second is to know
when to stop. On such an occasion, and
in such company, it would probably have
taxed the wit of a Disraeli not to have
said something offensive. Mr. Curling
wanted Mr. Disraeli&#8217;s wit, and the result
therefore was, he, to the confusion of
everybody, began to apologise for eloping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
with Conny; assuring us, and the servants
who stood choking at the door,
that he never would have been guilty of
such a mistake had he not worshipped
the ground his ker-ker-Conny trod on.</p>

<p>This was too much for my aunt. It
was bad enough that so delicate a matter
should have been referred to at all:
of its peculiar inopportuneness at that
moment, one had only to glance at the
giggling servants to understand. In a
loud, angry voice, she begged him to
cease, burst into tears, and rushed out
of the room.</p>

<p>Curling <i>did</i> cease; and, forgetting in
his nervousness that his chair was upset,
sat down before any of us could cry
out: the consequence of which was that
he tumbled head over heels, pulling the
table-cloth with him, and covering himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
with his unique collection of glass
and cutlery.</p>

<p>There was instantly a scramble. My
uncle, who thought Curling had fainted,
shouted to the servants for brandy.
Conny, weeping bitterly, fell on her
knees and picked the broken glass away
from the carpet near her husband&#8217;s head.
Theresa turned pale, and clasped her
hands; but I, suspecting by the young
fellow lying still that he couldn&#8217;t get
up, laid hold of his arm and pulled him
on to his legs.</p>

<p>Now then Conny&#8217;s affection displayed
itself. She clung to her husband, kissed
him, asked him if he was hurt and
where, behaved herself altogether so pathetically
that I felt myself a wretch for
having laughed to see him fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do let us go home!&#8221; she cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
turning to her papa. &#8220;We are <i>so</i> much
happier alone. Theodore never wanted to
come, and mamma will break his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ay, and his neck too, she might have
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! go home! go home!&#8221; exclaimed
my poor uncle. &#8220;Tell James,
one of you, to bring the phaeton round.
I have acted cruelly in subjecting you
both to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hurt,&#8221; said Curling, rubbing
his back, obviously relieved by the prospect
of an immediate release.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t somebody pick up that
chair?&#8221; exclaimed my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have done so,&#8221; replied Conny,
&#8220;but I didn&#8217;t like to interrupt Theodore,
for fear of breaking the thread of his
ideas. Mary, go and get me my hat,
it&#8217;s in mamma&#8217;s bed-room.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>In a few minutes the phaeton was
ready, the young couple, wearing now far
cheerfuller faces than we who were left
behind, jumped up, and off they drove.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next time they come to dinner,&#8221;
said my uncle, wiping his forehead with
a pocket handkerchief, &#8220;shall be at somebody
else&#8217;s invitation. I&#8217;ll never subject
the poor things to such treatment again
whilst I have breath in my body.&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Croaker.</i> &#8220;Well, if they concealed their
amour, they shan&#8217;t conceal their wedding; that shall
be public, I&#8217;m resolved.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Good-natured Man.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> aunt afterwards apologised to us
for having lost her temper, but I was
heartily glad my uncle had resolved not to
ask the young couple to dinner again. A
few scenes of this kind would hardly fail
to drive Theresa away, and without
Theresa, what were life?</p>

<p>And to tell you the truth, the less I
should see of Conny, the more, I felt,
should I be pleased. I was so much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
love with Theresa, that all reference to
the past was peculiarly disagreeable. To
have had Conny&#8217;s large, blue, surprised eyes
watching me whilst I talked with her
cousin, and cut my little jokes and looked
happy, would have been more than I
could bear.</p>

<p>Next morning my uncle suggested to
me that I should remain at Grove End
and amuse Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will be dull with my wife,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;whose temper makes her bad company.&#8221;
This proposal was perfectly agreeable
to me, and I had the pleasure of
spending a happier day than I firmly
believe was ever passed even at Rosherville.
Unfortunately, we could not ride,
because Theresa&#8217;s habit had not arrived
from Thistlewood; but we could walk,
and talk, and pick the flowers, and lounge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
under the cool trees, and snatch Arcadian
joys from the breezy quiet grounds.</p>

<p>I longed to find out whether it was
amiability that kept her happy in my
company, or some more complimentary,
some tenderer feeling. Somehow or other,
I couldn&#8217;t make love to her as I had
made love to Conny. Nothing had been
easier than to mutter my eternal devotion
into the ears of the golden-haired maid;
nothing was harder than to pay Theresa
even a compliment. It was not that
she was cold; on the contrary, she was
very genial. She gave me every reason
to believe that my society pleased her;
and throughout the long day, during
which we were constantly together, never
once suggested that she had had enough
of me. The fault was mine, not hers.
I was diffident. I was shy, bashful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
muffish. Conny and other young ladies
(who shall be nameless, for they may still
be single) I had been able to make love
to, as I have said, easily; but Theresa
awed me. She was so honest, so open-hearted
and candid, so womanly, so superior
in numberless points to the girls
whose friendship or whose hearts I had
had the honour of possessing, that I could
as soon have deliberately insulted her, as
indulged in any of those light and jocose
strokes of sentimentality with which I had
been heretofore used to pay my court.</p>

<p>One thing struck both of us that afternoon
and made us laugh: she had stopped
at Grove End to be a companion for my
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure she has enjoyed your
society very much,&#8221; said I, ironically.</p>

<p>And she blushed and averted her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
with a self-conscious expression upon it
that filled me with delight.</p>

<p>However, I don&#8217;t think my aunt wanted
her. The good lady was very gloomy,
and quite impenetrable to the attacks of
cheerfulness. When we entered the house,
we caught her helping a servant to pack
a hamper, which she boldly avowed was
for her daughter; and the moment the
servant left the room she exclaimed,</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter shan&#8217;t be starved by
that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was prejudice!</p>

<p>&#8220;Starved!&#8221; I cried; &#8220;why, poor fellow,
he worships her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so he ought. But all young
men of his kind are intolerably selfish
and never think of their wives&#8217; necessities,
so long as their own are supplied.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>&#8220;Why his kind particularly?&#8221; asked
Theresa, with a glance at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he is <i>not</i> a gentleman,&#8221;
answered my aunt.</p>

<p>Nothing but time will cure this stubbornness,
I thought, turning away.</p>

<p>The young people were to be married
&#8220;properly&#8221; on Monday morning, at
nine o&#8217;clock. This early hour was fixed
that the people at Updown might not
get scent of the proceedings. Curling, in
my presence, had protested against the
ceremony, as superfluous. But my uncle
was firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never consider my daughter
your wife, sir,&#8221; he exclaimed with some
heat, &#8220;until the service as directed by
the Church of England has been read
over you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>&#8220;But we <i>are</i> married!&#8221; urged Curling.
&#8220;Thoroughly married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say you are not!&#8221; shouted my
uncle. &#8220;You dare not disobey me,
sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything you want,&#8221; replied
Curling: &#8220;but I shall go to my grave
protesting against this second ceremony.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked forward to the ceremony with
many misgivings, having no doubt that
my aunt would misconduct herself.
When Monday morning came we all rose
very early, and supplied, at the breakfast
table, such an assemblage of dolorous
faces, that more dejection could not have
been expressed, had we been going to
escort some favourite relation to the
gallows. My uncle proposed that
Theresa and I should walk to the church
in advance of him and his wife, lest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
should we go in a body, the attention of
the people might be drawn, and a procession
follow us to the altar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to keep this matter secret,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>So Theresa and I started alone.</p>

<p>It was a bright, fresh morning, so gay
and sunny that all depression was out
of the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is proper to look wretched
on these occasions,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But what
is a man to do if he <i>can&#8217;t</i> cry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any reason to be dull,&#8221;
answered Theresa, &#8220;though aunt&#8217;s face
makes cheerfulness rather difficult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how we should feel if <i>we</i>
were going to be married?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>&#8220;Would you like to be going to be
married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were the bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her head away and grew
so nervous, that her step quickened, and
I had to catch her hand to detain her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Theresa,&#8221; I exclaimed, whilst my
heart beat violently, &#8220;I had no intention
of frightening you with a declaration
when we left the house. But&mdash;but,
dearest&mdash;haven&#8217;t you foreseen that&mdash;that
I should speak to you before long&mdash;that&mdash;that
I should tell you&mdash;&mdash;Oh Theresa!&#8221; I
gasped, &#8220;I am so agitated I can scarcely
speak. My impulse has taken my breath
away. My darling, I am in love with
you. I fell in love with you at Thistlewood,
and I am able to think of nothing&mdash;of
nobody but you.... Oh, tell me
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite impossible that you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have learnt to love me in this short time,&#8221;
she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can it be impossible when I <i>do</i>
love you? I know what you are thinking
of&mdash;Conny. Don&#8217;t, pray don&#8217;t. If it
were in my power to bare my heart, you&#8217;d
know then that I loved you. No, no. I
have been weak&mdash;all men are. I may
have flirted&mdash;I may have played the fool,
but all <i>that</i> is over, a deep and serious
play is begun. Do you believe me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me steadily, let her eyes
fall, and answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe you are in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced around to see that nobody
was in sight and, Eugenio, I kissed her.
&#8220;Will you marry me?&#8221; I asked her.</p>

<p>She was so long silent that I feared
my kiss had made her indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; she answered presently, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
wish you had taken a longer time to
consider your feelings before you spoke
to me. Have I any right to depend
upon your love when I see how quickly
you can forget the old and take to the
new?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; I exclaimed, bitterly; &#8220;I always
feared that Conny would come between
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not Conny, but your own heart.
Can you be faithful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to tell you I love you,
would you abandon me for the first
pretty girl you met?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try me,&#8221; I groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;that it is
papa&#8217;s wish I should marry you; but I
would rather die than give my hand to a
man on whose sincerity I could not rely.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>To this, Eugenio, what did I answer?
Credit me when I assure you that I
answered her eloquently. I was inspired.
It was not alone the beauty of her eyes,
the rapture of the kiss I had stolen, her
blushing face, the sense of security that
is bred by solitude, the glorious blue of
the morning heavens, and the sweetness
of the breeze rich with odours from the
fields and woods, which gave me power
to speak; the impulse that had broken
through my diffidence had also annihilated
it. Why write down what I said to her?
Why describe her appearance as she listened?
We have jogged on so far very
well without sentiment: let us not take
a dose of it now.</p>

<p>I solemnly protest that I had left
Grove End with Theresa, en route for the
church, with no more intention of telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
my love than of playing at leap-frog with
the haystacks on the road. This has
happened to others. Have I not seen?
No rules govern the heart. At the most
unexpected moment love is blurted out,
proposals of marriage stammered through;
emotion triumphs over fear, and even
imbecility grows eloquent. Let the ladies
be grateful for these little bursts of passion.
Were it all premeditation, all
rehearsal, few would be the offers made.
Young Froth, adoring Lauretta, breaks
into a cold sweat over the idea of a
formal submission of his heart and fortune.
To-morrow and to-morrow and
to-morrow steals on this petty pace, and
Froth has still to propose. Ah, nights
of agony, days of ineffable meditation,
how have ye worn this gentle shepherd!
At last, a glass of champagne and a ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
minutes&#8217; lounge in the balcony after the
feverish waltz, do the work. With a
ghastly look at the man in the moon,
Froth mumbles his feelings; he is accepted
on the spot, and his fears are at an end.
<i>De te fabula</i>, &amp;c. Change the name, and
the story is told of thee.</p>

<p>Had I begun to think when, how,
where, and in what language I should
propose, I might have been a bachelor to
this day.</p>

<p>That walk to the church! (it took us
three quarters of an hour) how sentimental
was it! Did I enjoy it? was I
happy? was Theresa happy? Surely
such questions are in bad taste since
they imply a doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;what would I
give, Theresa, if instead of going to Conny&#8217;s
marriage we were going to our own!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t look too pleased,&#8221; she
answered, with a laugh, &#8220;or we shall
grieve poor aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said I, &#8220;if she will
guess what this walk of ours has
terminated in. How glad your father will
be! how we shall delight uncle Tom!
Wonderful is life! only the other day
I was thinking you a rude, uncivilised
female, fit only to shoot pistols and break
horses; and now&mdash;and <i>now</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And only the other day,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;I was making up my mind to insult you
as grossly as I possibly could, to disgust
and drive you out of my sight, so
odious was the notion of having a
husband forced upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now it is otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>We reached the church where we
found nobody but the clerk, who, after
inquiring our business, conducted us with
a stealthy face to a seat. Scarcely three
minutes after we had entered, Conny and
her husband, both looking very pale and
agitated, came up to us. The poor fellow
shook hands with me and muttered,</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider this quite superfluous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll soon be over,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t make Conny more my wife
than she is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear friend,&#8221; said I, &#8220;consider
yourselves in the light of a book which
is to be handsomely re-bound. The first
plain binding keeps the leaves as securely
together as the richer covers will, but
the gilt and morocco are necessary to
your importance.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>Here my uncle and aunt entered, the
former gazing about him, into the
pews and up at the gallery, to make sure
that no spectators were present. At the
same moment the clock struck nine, forth
stepped the rector in full dress out of
the vestry, and the clerk beckoned to us
to take our places.</p>

<p>The marriage service is always a trial
to married people to hear, it is so full of
reproaches. My aunt cried so abundantly
that I every moment expected to see her
bump upon the floor in hysterics. However
she kept her feet stoutly, and I truly
hoped that the tender and beautiful words
she was listening to would soften her
towards the young fellow whose reverential
face and ardent glances at his little wife
persuaded me that all would go well with
them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>On the completion of the ceremony, my
uncle grasped my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>I glanced in the direction he indicated
and beheld the porch of the church crowded
with women with here and there a man
among them; while several females had
pushed their way into the pews and were
watching us with profound interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared, I feared we should never be
able to keep this a secret,&#8221; whispered my
uncle, &#8220;but why weren&#8217;t the doors shut?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doors shut! what manner of woodwork,
what manner of brickwork, would
keep women away from a marriage? I
believe were a wedding to be celebrated
at the bottom of a well, two or three ladies
would be found swinging in or holding
on to the bucket, watching the proceedings.
What, my dears, <i>what</i> is there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the spectacle of half a dozen or more or
less people standing before a clergyman
so astounding, so novel, so exciting as to
cause you to abandon your babies, your
wash-tubs, your lodgers, your cooking, to
witness it? Positively this hungry and
piercing curiosity fully justifies the remark
my friend Adolphe Beau once made
to me: &#8220;Either weddings in England are
exceedingly rare, monsieur, or else they
symbolise some hideous sacrifice compared
to which the African celebration of their
King&#8217;s nuptials are innocent childplay:
or whence comes your morbid national
love of witnessing these sights?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thank God, this is over,&#8221; exclaimed
my uncle, receiving Conny from
her blubbering mamma, and kissing her.</p>

<p>Poor Conny! was she so perfectly satisfied
with her husband that she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
think without regret upon the breakfast
she had missed, the speeches, the congratulations,
the blonde and the tulle, the
bouquets, the presents, and the triumphal
drive to the railway station, she had
forfeited? Ah, miss, you who are reading
this, see what you will be infallibly
deprived of if ever you dare to run away
with a young man unknown to your
parents. A midnight excursion may be
romantic: but, take my word for it, a
noontide festival, of which you are the
heroine, is a great deal more comfortable.
Don&#8217;t believe your Edward, who tells you
that he despises the flummery of the
marriage-show; that a registrar in his
sight is as good as a parson; that friends
are a nuisance, and speeches detestable.
It is true that veils and champagne don&#8217;t
make happiness; but they leave a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
impression, which he for one won&#8217;t forget.
Bridesmaids and flowers won&#8217;t prevent
you from quarrelling; but they will put
it out of his power to say several unpleasant
things when you and he <i>do</i> quarrel.
A wedding is a launch; and, depend
upon it, there is no better way to slip
into the ocean of life than with
streamers flying, bands playing, and
kindly hands to chase our flying feet
with wine.</p>

<p>Conny and her husband returned to
their lodgings with my uncle, who desired
me to escort the ladies home. The first
thing that I did after we were out of
the town was to tell my aunt that
Theresa had accepted me. She received
the intelligence without an ejaculation.
All she did was to force a smile and
say,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>&#8220;I expected it would come to that.
I am very pleased. Thomas will be
delighted. Poor, poor Conny!&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing how utterly engrossed she was
by her daughter&#8217;s fate, I squeezed Theresa&#8217;s
hand by way of apologising to her
for dropping the subject of our engagement,
and began a long and vigorous
appeal for Curling. I think I must have
grown warm; for I have a recollection
of reproaching her for her behaviour,
which, I pointed out, was not only calculated
to make her daughter miserable,
but to excite her contempt for her husband,
and so create feelings which would
result in rendering the elopement calamitous
in a very different and sterner
sense than it now was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay I am wrong. I daresay I
am to blame,&#8221; she kept on saying.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>Theresa at last silenced me by whispering:</p>

<p>&#8220;All the talk in the world will not
make her see the matter in its true
light, yet; it will probably dawn upon
her in a few weeks; but arguments now
will do nothing but harden her.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Puff.</i> &#8220;Now gentlemen, this scene goes entirely
for what we call situation and stage effect, by which
the greatest applause may be obtained without the
assistance of ... sentiment or character. Pray mark.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Critic.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">I returned</span> to the Bank after seeing the
ladies to Grove End, and going straight
into my uncle&#8217;s private room, told him
that Theresa and I were engaged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Engaged!&#8221; he cried, staring at me.
&#8220;Are you in earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>I never saw any man look so
pleased.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>&#8220;It is almost time,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I
had something to give my spirits a turn.
<i>This</i> delights me. But, good gracious!
how sudden! how unexpected! I had
no idea you were in love with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came home from Thistlewood in
love; but I never meant to ask her to
be my wife yet awhile. My feelings
overpowered me this morning and out
came everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And does she love you, Charlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose she would accept
me if she didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure she wouldn&#8217;t. Of course
she loves you. Well, well, this <i>is</i> cheering
news after our late troubles. That
old scheme of mine was quite pushed out
of my mind by this elopement. I have
been able to think of nothing else. Now
at all events there will be <i>one</i> marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
after my heart. Has she written to Dick
yet about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you see, I only proposed to her
this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, I forgot. You had better go to
her. We can very well do without you
just now&mdash;far better than she can. Upon
my word,&#8221; he cried, grasping my hand,
&#8220;your news is as good as a cordial. It
throws quite a bright light on the future,
and I can see my way now as I never
saw it before. But I&#8217;ll not keep you.
Get away to Grove End. We&#8217;ll talk the
thing over this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left him, but stopped a moment to
ask Curling, who was at his desk,
how he and Conny felt after the wedding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well thank you, Mr. Hargrave,&#8221;
he replied: &#8220;but as I told your uncle, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
shall go to my grave protesting that it
was entirely superfluous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! come, you must confess that
you feel more comfortable now that you
have been married correctly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and whilst I live
I shall always say it was superfluous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said I, halting as I was
moving off, as though arrested by an afterthought:
&#8220;you might tell Conny when
you see her that I am engaged to be
married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my cousin Theresa has done me
the honour to accept me. The news will
interest your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And delight her too,&#8221; said Curling,
&#8220;for she still worries now and then over
the trick we were unavoidably&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell her to forget everything as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
have,&#8221; I interrupted quickly, for I never
could stand any reference to that trick
from him. &#8220;She has nothing to forget
so far as I am concerned, as I hope my
engagement proves.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I left the bank.</p>

<p>I found Theresa alone&mdash;my aunt having
been seized with an auspicious fit of
tenderness which had driven her (in
her carriage) to her daughter&#8217;s lodgings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems that I was destined to make
love to you,&#8221; said I; &#8220;for I am perpetually
finding you by yourself all alone,
as the song says, and opportunity creates
the thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly believe we are engaged,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;We have, I fear, both
been too hasty&mdash;you in proposing, I in
accepting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean to imitate Conny, I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
better withdraw to my bed-room and cut
my gorge. What! accept me, and then
break into lamentations?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> can be true,&#8221; said she, firmly and
proudly, &#8220;and do not speak of myself.
But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was only one way of silencing
her buts, and that was by stopping her
mouth. I leave you to guess how I did
it. There was a vast deal of blushing,
tender charges of sauciness, assumptions
of indignation which the eyes vowed were
terrible hypocrisies, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But, my Eugenio, even were love-making
not an amusement in which no breathing
creature can take the faintest interest,
save those who are concerned in it, still
ought I, and do I, politely but firmly
decline to set down the particulars of that
dear, delightful morning. The very respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
fear of growing sentimental is
one check; but another and a more violent
restraint is that profound sense of what
d&#8217;ye call it? with which most men recur
to the nonsense they are forced to emit
when the fit is on them.</p>

<p>However, I ought not to conceal that
our conversation brought out some little
secrets of great value and moment to me;
of which one was the assurance that she
had fallen in love with me before I left
Thistlewood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never suspected it,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;that
I should have been so easily conquered
had I not been resolved to atone for the
cruel reception I gave you, and the wicked
story I told O&#8217;Twist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tried to harden your heart,&#8221; said
I; &#8220;but the process that ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
made iron of it transformed it into
wax.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. I am a silly creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better, dearest; for
were you wise I might be miserable. A
woman must love a man for something;
and providing he gains her love, the
means by which he wins her ought not
to trouble either of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon we each wrote to our
respective fathers. What Theresa said I
don&#8217;t know; but my letter was a very
candid confession of happiness.</p>

<p>I <i>was</i> happy. I loved this cousin of
mine dearly. It is true that I had had
to undergo no ordeal for her. I had
neither (to use a favourite order of
description) been tried by the fire,
nor proved in the furnace; &#8220;long years&#8221;
had had nothing whatever to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
with my love. I had been guilty of
no &#8220;passionate yearnings,&#8221; nor &#8220;wild
and wistful longings.&#8221; And I don&#8217;t
think I had been &#8220;thrilled&#8221; once. In
short, my passion was totally unlike
those which are heard of at Mr. Mudie&#8217;s.
And yet I am bold to say that no hero
was ever fonder of the heroine whom he
wooes in chapter the first, and loses
in chapter the second, recovers in
chapter the third, doubts in chapter
the fourth, quarrels with in chapter the
fifth, grows sardonic over in chapter the
sixth, adores in chapter the seventh, flees
in chapter the eighth, and finally marries
in chapter the sixty-fourth, than I was
of Theresa whom I had known only a
few weeks, and whom, when I had first
met her, I had execrated.</p>

<p>Uncle Dick arrived at Grove End<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
next day in high spirits. I remember
that after making me all manner of
handsome compliments, he whispered,
&#8220;Nobody shall be miserable when my
daughter is happy;&#8221; and unknown to
any of us left the house and after an
hour&#8217;s absence returned&mdash;with Curling
and Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are!&#8221; he cried, in great
glee, joining us on the lawn. &#8220;I was
just in time. Conny had fetched her
beloved at the bank and was on the
point of starting for a walk. They were
very reluctant to come: but I told
them we couldn&#8217;t be happy without
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conny turned a little pale when she
met me, but soon recovered her composure
and whispered her congratulations
with her deep blue eyes fully upturned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to mine. I gazed calmly into their
depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;May you be very happy!&#8221; said she,
and kissed me.</p>

<p>Eheu! when I wanted her kisses she
wouldn&#8217;t give them.</p>

<p>Thanks to uncle Dick, our dinner-party
that day was a very much livelier one
than the last at which the young couple
had been present. Without embarrassing
Curling, he contrived to make a very
great deal of him, engaged him in a
conversation on topics on which the
young man was well qualified to talk,
and developed so many really good
social points in him, that not only was
I never more favourably impressed, but
I actually caught my aunt regarding her
son-in-law with a face absolutely promising
with a propitiatory expression.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Her Theodore&#8217;s success delighted poor
little Conny, who, long before the dinner
was over, was chatting; and laughing as
playfully as ever she had done in the
days when she was the darling of the
house, and life lay round her like a
landscape of flowers and sunshine. She
sat next to her mother, and I assure
you that I would rather have forfeited
the pleasure of having Theresa by my
side at the table than missed the satisfaction
of seeing Conny slip her hand
into her mother&#8217;s, and leave it there to
be nursed and petted.</p>

<p>That evening my uncles and myself
had a long conversation on a great
variety of topics, all which were of
prodigious interest to me, since they all
concerned me very closely. Besides a
handsome settlement on his daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Dick promised to make us a present of
a large sum of money, which was to
procure me a partnership in uncle Tom&#8217;s,
bank. But though that sum was considerable,
the income uncle Tom promised
me, not the most rapacious money-lender
could have made it yield.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taking the capital Dick gives you
at five per cent.,&#8221; said he, &#8220;your income
would be £0,000; the difference, then,
between that income and the sum you
will draw, you will consider <i>my</i> present.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was overpowered by so much generosity;
and, utterly wanting words, had
to content myself with silently shaking
their hands. It was a real relief to me
when they began to talk of Curling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had always proposed,&#8221; said uncle
Tom, &#8220;to make the man my daughter
married a partner in the bank; but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
course I never anticipated that she would
marry a man like Curling. However,
waiving the consideration of his poverty,
a fitter man than Curling to take in with
us I don&#8217;t think I could choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could,&#8221; said uncle
Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is extraordinarily active,&#8221; continued
uncle Tom, &#8220;and were he to be
given an interest in the bank, would
by his efforts and business habits extend
its influence to a degree that would
abundantly compensate for his want of
capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him in by all means,&#8221; said
uncle Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be in too great a hurry.
There is plenty of time. He has behaved
ill, though I am willing to forgive him for
my girl&#8217;s sake; but there would be a want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of moral propriety in my heaping benefits
upon him too suddenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; said uncle Dick. &#8220;But
Charlie grows uneasy and pines for his
sweetheart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; I answered, and without
ceremony left the room.</p>

<p>Theresa received a letter next morning
from my father, and a very gorgeous
epistle it was&mdash;a series of dignified and
embroidered congratulations and loftily-expressed
good wishes. She was to let
him know the date of her marriage and
he would join us two or three days before
at the house we should be married from.
This letter was read aloud and caused an
argument. Which house <i>should</i> we be
married from? It was soon shown that
Thistlewood was out of the question. It
was impossible for uncle Tom to absent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
himself from Updown, owing to his presence
being necessary at the bank, and the
same objection held good with respect to
Curling, whose presence and Conny&#8217;s at
the breakfast was regarded by us all as
essential to the celebration.</p>

<p>&#8220;For,&#8221; said my uncle Dick, &#8220;the breakfast
must be given as much in their honour
as in that of Charlie&#8217;s and Theresa&#8217;s;
their healths have never yet been properly
drunk, and until that solemnity has been
gone through, they cannot, in spite of the
double ceremony they have endured, be
considered correctly married yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both my uncles were impatient that
the marriage should not be delayed, and
therefore not without a good deal of persuasion,
I succeeded in getting Theresa to
fix the day for&mdash;&mdash;which gave us exactly
six weeks to make our preparations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
With less time we could hardly do.
There were not only two houses to be
sought and furnished (Dick being resolved
that Theresa and Conny should both
begin the duties of housekeeping at the
same time) but there were two trousseaux
to be got ready, for as one of us very
properly observed, &#8220;It isn&#8217;t because a girl
makes a runaway marriage that she
doesn&#8217;t want the same outfit that would
be given her had she been married
correctly.&#8221;</p>

<p>A busy month that was! Theresa
went to Thistlewood, but returned after
an absence of a fortnight; her father
declaring that no nonsensical fastidiousness
should permit her to mope alone in
a big house, which would be all the
more dull, not only because it was the
home she was to leave for ever, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
because she would contrast it with the
cheerfulness of the house at Grove End.</p>

<p>One individual welcomed her back,
trust me.</p>

<p>That, I say, was a busy month. Two
houses had been found, exactly &#8220;suited
to the requirements of young married
people,&#8221; as the landlords pointed out: one
house in Updown, which was for Conny;
and one a mile away, not very far from
Grove End, which was for Theresa. These
had to be furnished; and as my uncle
Tom had no time to devote to the work,
I was &#8220;told off&#8221; to assist uncle Dick.</p>

<p>And now at Grove End Conny was to
be found every day, helping her mother
to prepare for Theresa&#8217;s marriage, to get
together her own trousseau, to sympathise
with her cousin&#8217;s maidenly anxieties. She
and I were often together now; but so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
little did the memory of the past affect
our relations&mdash;in short, so dead was all
sentiment between us, that, though Theresa
watched us narrowly (which she
afterwards declared was not true), not a
glance, not a sigh was exchanged upon
which the most imaginative jealousy could
have fastened as an excuse for a quarrel.</p>

<p>My father arrived at Grove End a
week before the marriage. Both my uncles
went to meet him with the phaeton. As
I beheld his stately figure I felt that I
had never sufficiently admired him. He
certainly did look most imposing, dressed
to perfection, his magnificent whiskers
taking a purple tint from the sun. He
grasped both my hands, and I led him
at once to Theresa. Good heavens! with
what inimitable grace did he take and
kiss her hand; with which chivalrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
greeting, however, she was by no means
satisfied, for she insisted upon offering her
cheek, which he touched with the imperial
air of a potentate saluting a queen.
And a queen she looked! and I noticed
with happy pride the admiration that
kindled in his face as he regarded her.
Indeed, I had very good reason to be
proud of both of them; for such a father
and such a bride, I will venture to say,
it has been the lot of very few men to
possess at the same time.</p>

<p>My aunt, who had not seen the major
for many years, was quite overpowered
by the reception he gave her; whilst
honest Tom was so vain of having his
military brother under his roof, that for
very conceit he couldn&#8217;t sit down, but
strode about the room, putting all manner
of questions about France, the Emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
prospects of war with that country, and
so forth, positively as if my father were
a returned ambassador, whose intimacy
with French affairs qualified him to raise
or depress the Funds with a shrug or a
nod.</p>

<p>One thing I could predict: the presence
of the major would entirely nullify every
lingering feeling of humiliation with
which Tom and his wife might still
regard Conny&#8217;s marriage. So gorgeous a
relation could not but absorb out of the
family circle the remnants of degradation
Conny&#8217;s elopement had left behind it;
and uncle Tom might well defy the
neighbours to sneer after having set eyes
on the military representative of the
Hargraves, with his magnificent whiskers
and aquiline nose, when he should sit
by his sister-in-law in the carriage, resembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a monarch on a <i>tour d&#8217;inspection</i>,
or when he worshipped with lofty
solemnity in the family pew.</p>

<p>The following extract is from the
<i>Updown Mercury</i> of &mdash;&mdash;, 185&mdash;. I
subjoin it because the particulars it gives
are expressed in language which, whether
we consider the beauty of its epithets,
the elegance of its construction, the ease
of its periods, or the harmony of its
sentences, is equally provocative of lasting
admiration, and is so superior to anything
I could write, that it would be
injurious to the reputation of this book
to omit it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fashionable Marriage,&mdash;On Thursday
last our delightfully-situated town was
thrown into a state of unusual excitement
by the solemnisation of the marriage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Charles Hargrave, Esq., son of Major
Hargrave, and nephew of our respected
fellow-townsman, Thomas Hargrave, Esq.,
to Theresa, only child of Richard Hargrave,
Esq., of Thistlewood. The whole
of the population turned out to celebrate
the joyous occasion. The noble and
ancient gateway in High Street was
elegantly draped with flags, and a
triumphal arch of great beauty was
erected at the bottom of Grove End Lane.
The church was densely packed, and an
immense concourse of people assembled
around the doors to witness the bridal
party leave the sacred edifice. The bride
wore a magnificent robe of white satin,
and looked, to quote the words of a
celebrated bard,</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;Beautiful exceedingly.&#8217;</p>

<p>The dresses of the bridesmaids were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
beyond praise, and elicited murmurs of
admiration. The service was read impressively
by the rector, assisted by the
Reverend John Cattle, M.A.: Mr. Abrahams
presided at the organ. The bridal
party left the church and were driven
to Grove End, where a recherché breakfast
awaited the happy guests. The
usual toasts were eloquently proposed and
eloquently responded to. We must not
forget to say that the breakfast involved
a double celebration; the other happy
pair being Theodore Curling, Esq., of
London, and Constance, the only child
of Thomas Hargrave, Esq. Much amusement
was created by the very droll
speech delivered by Mr. Richard Hargrave
in proposing the health of Mr. and Mrs.
Curling; and hearty and cordial was
the applause that greeted the few but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
graceful words with which Mr. Curling
acknowledged the honour that was
done him and his fair bride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hargrave
left Grove End for the railway station
at Updown at one o&#8217;clock, en route for
the south of France, where we believe
it is their intention to pass the honeymoon.
Our best wishes follow them
into their blissful though temporary
retirement; nor can we close this inadequate
notice of the auspicious event,
without tendering our respectful congratulations
to the parents of the young
people whom the marriage cements with
new and indissoluble domestic ties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here I lay down my pen, having
brought as much of the story of my
life as I meant to relate, to an end.</p>

<p>Though I want you to accept the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
as a work of fiction, who knows whether
there may not be a great deal of truth
in it? But whether there is or not, one
thing is certain&mdash;there is no moral in the
story: and if this is not a literary excellence
of a very high order, perhaps somebody
will tell me what is.</p>

<p>A little more, perhaps, might be said
about Curling and his wife, if I were not
sure that you had long ago settled in
your mind that Curling would one day
become good friends with his mother-in-law.
If I add that at this time of
writing, he has been a partner for seven
years in the banking firm of Hargrave
and Co., the sequel of <i>his</i> matrimonial
adventure will be as fully related as if
a volume were devoted to that purpose.</p>
